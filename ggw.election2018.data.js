      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including at least $167 million from Maryland? How would you achieve this and what funds would you use? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "Yes, I do. The health of Metro is absolutely critical to the future of our state and dedicated funding is the only way to ensure sustainability. I support SB0277/HB 372 sponsored by Senator Brian Feldman and Delegate Marc Korman that provides at least $125 million in dedicated funding for Metro annually from the Transportation Trust Fund. When I supported the enhanced investments to the Transportation Trust Fund in 2013, the legislature made a commitment to the voters that this money would go into the Transportation Trust Fund for purposes of supporting mass transit options. We have to honor that commitment. As one of the most densely populated states in the country, Maryland needs leadership that values the principles of smart growth and makes strategic investments in mass transit infrastructure over road construction. Finally, a path to dedicated funding doesn't happen without the support of political leadership in D.C. and Virginia. While I believe the best way to lead is by example, I WILL also continue to build on strong regional partnerships that I've developed as County Executive of Prince George's County in order to maximize the strengths of our region for the benefit of our residents."

      "question": "Do you support Governor Hogan's proposed expansion of I-495, I-270, and/or the BW Parkway? Why or why not? With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "I do not support the Governor's proposed $9 billion road expansion proposal. Prioritizing highway expansion is not a sustainable, long-term solution to our traffic woes. We've seen time and time again that more lanes on the highway leads to more cars on the road. What we have to pursue in Maryland is a cultural shift away from single-occupancy vehicles towards mass transit options. Investments in transportation infrastructure must focus on moving the most people as fast as possible, rather than moving the most cars as fast as possible. I would prioritize projects such as the Southern Light Rail project in Charles County and a modified version of the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT) BRT project in Montgomery County and explore extending the CCT all the way up to Hagerstown. These are 21st century solutions to our transit problems that will not only connect more people to jobs and take more cars off the road, but projects that will spur economic development in the communities they serve."

      "question": "Do you think the State Highway Administration appropriately balances walking, bicycling, car, and transit needs or does it favor fast car movement to the exclusion of other needs? Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "Traffic-related deaths are a critical problem in Maryland right now. In fact, traffic fatalities have increased by 18% in the past three years. I applaud County Executive Leggett and the Montgomery County Council for adopting the “Vision Zero” program. We've taken similar best practices from “Vision Zero” and have started to implement them in Prince George's County. While this a great first step for the region, the majority of traffic fatalities occur on state roads, so state leadership is absolutely necessary to make progress on this issue. As Governor, I will make Maryland the first state to adopt Vision Zero and set us on the path towards zero traffic-related deaths by 2030. What I admire about Vision Zero is that it encourages cooperation between local communities and local government and presents a “bottom-up” approach to solving these problems. Across the state, local residents know which roads and intersections in their communities are dangerous, but they need proactive channels of communication with local and state government to implement solutions."

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Absolutely. We have to ensure that existing residents and businesses benefit from the development around the Purple Line and that we preserve affordable housing options in those communities. That is why I joined County Executive Ike Leggett and University of Maryland President Wallace Loh in signing the Purple Line Corridor Community Compact that lays out four important goals: to support and grow local businesses, to build a thriving labor market, to make affordable housing available and to support vibrant communities.     As County Executive, I have vast experience with transit-oriented development in communities such as Suitland and New Carrollton. As Governor, I would continue to support transit-oriented development around Metro stations and other mass transit options. I would support policies to increase the supply of market-rate and affordable housing to accommodate the increased demand to live in transit-rich areas, such as Bethesda and Silver Spring.     I strongly support Montgomery County Councilmember Floreen's bill (34-17) to require housing developments with less than 20 units to contribute to the Housing Initiative Fund to provide money for affordable housing projects in the County. I also applaud the Montgomery County Council's recent effort on a bill (36-17) to reduce the development impact tax burden on previously approved projects that provide additional dwelling units with at least 25% Moderately Priced Dwelling Units (MPDUs) in the addition.    I would also work with local zoning authorities to encourage that the development impact fees collected from projects in a Metro Station Policy Area be used for transportation improvements located in the same Metro area or an adjacent planning area. This is key to ensuring that existing residents and businesses in transit-rich areas are able to get around their community efficiently so that they may enjoy the benefits of increased development."

      "question": "Our region shares many things: a transit system, a housing market, even a football team. Would you like to see Maryland, Virginia, and DC collaborate to avoid a race to the bottom? How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Yes, Maryland, Virginia and DC are all interconnected via Metro/I-495 and would benefit from increased collaboration to avoid a race to the bottom. Regionalism is an approach that has not been seen in the DMV as we regularly compete against each other in an attempt to land new companies. When it comes to Amazon's HQ2, I have been publicly supportive of Montgomery County's bid for the White Flint area, however I firmly believe that if Amazon's HQ2 locates anywhere in the DMV it will have a tremendously positive ripple effect throughout the area. Our interconnectivity as a region is a strength that has not been played often enough when approaching massive regional opportunities.    Government officials, of course, cannot act alone in these massive regional projects and need widespread support from the business community. This is what makes organizations like GGW and The 2030 Group so important to help push officials to invest in crucial regional infrastructure improvements, especially between Maryland and Virginia.    Finally, my support and advocacy for regional priorities like the Purple Line dates back to my earliest days living in the state of Maryland. I am and will always be a regionalist that has worked across boundaries for decades, including recent Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments working groups on climate, transportation, water, planning, and public safety, among others. I was pleased to earn the support of GGW in my run for County Executive in 2010 and hope to earn your support in 2018."

      "response": "Yes, dedicated, bondable funding for Metro, to address years of deferred maintenance and serious safety problems is essential. I think $500 million per year and $167 million from Maryland is the minimum amount we should be committing as a region. Governance and labor issues must be addressed simultaneously with the commitment for sustained funding. There must be less discretion allowed WMATA about maintenance and safety protocols and complete buy in by the Transit Workers and other unions. I personally could support a regional sales or gas tax to generate funding but am open to other sources of dedicated funding."

With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "No, I do not support expanding travel lanes on 495, 270 or the Parkway. We should not be doing anything that further encourages single occupancy vehicle use. Transportation is now the number one source of carbon emissions and the main culprit is gasoline engines. If we are going to reduce and reverse climate change, we must change our transportation plans to expand bus rapid transit, commuter rail and traditional bus service with better connectivity, late night and weekend service so travelers aren't stranded or forced to take more expensive transportation like Uber/Lyft or taxis."

      "question": "Do you think the State Highway Administration appropriately balances walking, bicycling, car, and transit needs or does it favor fast car movement to the exclusion of other needs? Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "The State Highway Administration's no. 1 priority is and always has been cars, so no it does not balance that with pedestrian, bicycle or transit needs. It is doing better only because of public and political pressure and because of the problem of pedestrian fatalities. In Prince George's County, the bulk of those fatalities occur on our state roads. SHA should absolutely be charged legislatively with elevating pedestrian and bike safety and it can do so by replicating county efforts around this -- designing complete streets around transit hubs with narrower travel lanes for cars, traffic calming devices like chokers and landscaping and other features that force motorists to slow down and give pedestrians a chance to make safe crossings. This would have to be a legislative mandate as SHA will not do this of its own accord. Even if the leadership now would be amenable to this, with the change of administrations every 4-8 years, future leaders could change course."

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Yes, we need to adopt policies that prevent wholesale gentrification of transit areas and I have spoken out about this. I have been a proponent of reintroducing an affordable housing policy in Prince George's County more than 20 years after its repeal by County Executive Wayne Curry and the County Council in 1996. There is a misconception that Prince George's County has a sufficient number of affordable units. We simply do not. We have a lot of rental housing, yes, but it is aging and to the degree it is affordable, much of it is in poor condition. I did get one affordable housing policy passed in 2013 (CB-27-2013) that requires owners of multifamily rental housing with 20 or more units to offer the county housing department the right to buy the property before it is offered to a private party. The goal is to keep affordable units from converting to market rate units and, conversely, to convert market rate units to affordable units. I still feel strongly we need to bring back a law that requires developers to set aside 10-15 of new multi or single family housing units for households that make somewhere between 50 and 80% of AMI."

      "response": "I think there should be more coordination and would be willing to spearhead it on issues like Metro bus and rail service and stadium siting, but I don't think regional collaboration for a large employer such as Amazon is realistic. As an elected official, I have never once had a constituent say I wish you would work more with the District or Northern Virginia to bring this or that employer to the region. Everyone wants to work as close to home as possible and every individual jurisdiction wants the tax base and spin off economic activity a major employer like Amazon would bring. I love the concept of regionalism but I think it has limits."

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Yes.  I support increased density at new transit nodes, MPDU requirements to increase affordability as part of that density, and mandated assistance for existing businesses to allow them to survive during construction and thrive after.  I'm proud to support Sen. Will Smith's legislation to do just that."

How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Yes.  A regional approach is always best.  The traditional view is that a regional approach is too difficult, too cumbersome.  The dedicated Metro funding bill that I cosponsored and just voted for proved otherwise.  It makes clear that a regional approach can indeed work with a possible Amazon HQ or NFL stadium.  "

      "question": "DC is amending its Comprehensive Plan. Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "[The pressure placed on our neighbors to find affordable housing, let alone remain in it, is tremendous and at times inhumane. I support policies to add housing in all parts of the city, create and preserve much more affordable housing, and strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped, but the recently-revised Comprehensive Plan does very little of this. The Comprehensive Plan is centered on the idea of an “inclusive city,” but in reviewing the proposed revisions and meeting with members of my community who are already struggling to remain in their neighborhoods, it does the opposite. It is clear that the amendments stand to drastically change DC and were written with developer and real estate interests in mind, rather than the interests of our neighbors. Far from providing for an “inclusive city,” the proposed changes inject ambiguity, loosen definitions to key terms (e.g., residential and commercial definitions of low-, moderate-, medium-, and high-density), and weaken the Comp Plan's existing prescriptive power at the cost of further displacing our Black and Latinx residents, while doing nothing to address the definition of affordability and what it currently means for people for whom affordable housing is unaffordable. This is wrong.  Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the lack of transparency throughout the amendment process that OP has pursued. I have spoken with countless voters throughout Ward 6 who have been counting on this Comprehensive Plan amendment process to provide them with a pathway to stability and security in their longtime homes and neighborhoods. I've had more conversations than I can count with Ward 6 neighbors worried that the downstream impact of the revisions posed by OP will result in new, imposing development that will push even more Black and Latinx families out of our community. These are individuals who have lived in our city for 50-plus years who thought this process would provide them with a voice, due process, and a recognition by their city that their continued presence in and contributions to their community was valued, respected, and worthy of protection. In light of this revision process, that's the opposite of what the DC government is telling our neighbors.  I support a process that will support those who need our help. This starts by making sure all of the deliberation and decision-making leading to any revisions are transparent and available to everyone in the community who wishes to learn more about them. To date, that has not happened. Further, I support a revision and approval process that is driven by the DC Council, not the Zoning Commission, because decisions that will have such profound impact on individual neighborhoods need to be made by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people living in those neighborhoods. I applaud the efforts by local advocacy organizations such as Empower DC, and the ANCs holding OP and  the DC Council accountable for this obscure process that stands to forever change the future of DC, at the expense of many longtime residents.]"

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "[I support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes because our neighbors who rely on those modes of transportation should be able to do so safely, quickly, and efficiently. I am not opposed to removing on-street parking in order to achieve these goals where appropriate.  There are certainly some neighborhoods, and streets, where eliminating parking spaces would have substantial consequences for the neighborhood and residents. In many cases, protected bike lanes can be created by changing traffic and parking patterns, and enforcing traffic laws, without needing to eliminate parking. Transparency, public discussion, community input and government disclosure during the decision-making process are appropriate because each neighborhood, and each street, is different.  There are too many people in our communities who spent hours on the bus getting to and from work, appointments, and even the grocery store. To the extent that dedicated bus lanes can alleviate those unconscionable burdens, I am fully supportive. I also fully support the efforts to achieve Vision Zero, and to the extent that requires additional bike lanes I would be supportive. However, I am not a transportation expert, I am a mom and a neighbor who has worked in public policy my whole life and believes I can help my community by bringing new leadership. I do not see my role as that of one who should be dictating where bike and bus lanes should be placed, nor do I see my role as that of one who pretends to have mastered the profession of urban planning in order to answer a questionnaire. My role is to listen to advocates, riders, and members of the community, take their input and concerns seriously, and work to make their lives better.]"

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including $178 million from DC? How would you achieve this? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "[Yes. There is no reason for Metro to be the only major subway system in the nation without a dedicated funding stream. For many of the same reasons that I oppose raising fares in order to find this funding, I am opposed to any proposal that would seek to raise the sales tax in order to raise revenue for Metro. There are ways to find this money that do not involve placing a regressive tax burden on our low-income residents, including reversing the corporate and estate tax cuts that were given to businesses and wealthy DC residents over the last several years.  If DC is making this substantial investment in our Metro system, it's important for taxpayers to know that it will be handled responsibly, so I would also move forward with the recommendation of Secretary LaHood that the Metro governing board be overhauled and reformed with a smaller, more credible body that will drive us toward solutions rather than often being part of the problem themselves.]"

      "question": "Do you support funding the DC Streetcar to extend east to Benning Road Metro in Ward 7 and west in dedicated lanes to Georgetown? Or, what infrastructure to improve access by District residents to jobs, schools, and businesses would you support funding?",
      "response": "[I support letting residents of Ward 7 determine whether they believe a streetcar is the best way to provide them with access to jobs, schools and businesses, rather than the city making that determination for them.  The current H Street streetcar was built at great taxpayer expense, and while the promise of its construction may have incentivized growth in the eastern portion of the H Street corridor, the streetcar itself, once completed, did little if anything to sustain those businesses or promote additional growth. Given the amount of taxpayer dollars spent on the H Street line, and the opportunity cost of using those funds on a streetcar rather than to help alleviate our city's educational and housing shortfalls, it is hard to claim that the current iteration of the streetcar has been a success. Most neighbors I speak to express a strong preference to take the X2 for their daily commuting needs, in part because it is faster and more predictable, so it is hard to claim that the current iteration of the streetcar has been a success.  I support efforts to expand access to Metro, and within Ward 6 I am particularly supportive of the proposal to construct a NOMA entrance/exit point closer to Union Market. I also support improving the efficiency and reliability of transportation city-wide, because true disparities exist in our communities when it comes to access to reliable transportation that will get our neighbors to work on time, and at an affordable price. This is a problem that extends well beyond Ward 6, but it's our shared responsibility to address it.]"

      "question": "Last year, the DC Council approved $36 million in tax-increment financing to subsidize 600 additional parking spaces at Union Market. Are you supportive of the way that TIF proceeded or would you like to see changes for future TIFs, regarding parking and/or in general?",
      "response": "[No, I strongly opposed the Council's vote on the Union Market TIF, and I oppose any similar efforts in the future to fund commercial development. I would only support such taxpayer financing schemes in instances where the project is residential, and there is a clearly articulated plan to include a majority of truly affordable housing units within the project. My definition of truly affordable is not the same as the city's accepted definition of affordable housing – to me, truly affordable means units that our low- and ultra-low-income residents can actually afford.  I was disgusted to see that my councilmember voted in favor of the Union Market TIF. Commercial developers in Washington, DC are doing just fine, and did just fine even as we moved through a recession, while many of our neighbors are struggling to stay in their longtime homes. As a matter of principle, I will always prioritize the needs of our low-income residents over the wishes of wealthy commercial developers. My position is simple: once we make sure that every one of our neighbors has a safe, stable, affordable roof over their head, we can start considering whether to incentivize commercial development through tax incentives. The juxtaposition of a vote for a developer subsidy taken almost simultaneous to a vote against assisting our low-income residents was a glaring window into the priorities of the DC Council as presently constituted. It's not who we are as a city, and it's not who we are as a Ward.  Adding insult to injury, this TIF was primarily provided to fund the construction of an expensive parking garage that the city itself has said was unnecessary. We are in the midst of an affordable housing crisis, so tax subsidies and financing may be an appropriate budgetary tool in order to spur residential development that increases our affordable housing stock. That's not what this was.]"

      "question": "Nearly 20 percent of all property in DC is protected by historic preservation law - more than Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia combined. Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "[I am far less concerned about excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods than I am in ensuring current residents of many neighborhoods are able to remain in their neighborhoods, rather than being forced out due to the rising costs of home maintenance that can be a byproduct of living in a historic district. It is true that limitations imposed by historic districts will make it so many new families cannot buy homes and build additions that they would need to create sufficient space for their families, and that is a consequence that should be considered, but those considerations are dwarfed by the near-term consequence of expanding historic designations across the city – we are essentially evicting families from their longtime homes.  I fully support the spirit of historic designation, to the extent it exists to preserve the character and history of our neighborhoods. However, much of that character and history has become subjective, and does not mirror reality. The subjective rulemaking has led to skyrocketing maintenance costs, which many neighbors cannot afford. To the extent that historic districts are being expanded, these efforts should not be led by astro-turf organizations with pre-existing interests, but should be subject to the approval of the community as a whole, after public and transparent study, debate, and opportunity for comment.  I live in a historic district. My husband and I are well aware of the economic consequences and, more importantly, we knew what they were prior to purchasing our home. When we replaced our windows, we were required to purchase fully-wood windows, because the city would not allow us to purchase vinyl windows with wood caps. There is, literally, no aesthetic difference between what we could have bought and what we were required to buy, but there is a difference in energy efficiency and in the number of years they will last. As a result, our energy bills are higher than they could be, and our windows will have to be replaced approximately ten years earlier than they otherwise could have been.  With policies like these, we are placing a tremendous burden on low-income families. The unintended consequence is that many of our neighbors, particularly elderly neighbors who live on fixed incomes, put off necessary home repairs since they cannot afford expensive wood windows or authentic hand-cut slate roofs. Surely, we can find a policy that retains the character of our neighborhoods, limits inappropriate development, and allows our neighbors to afford to remain in the neighborhood, and the home, they love.]"

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "[We face significant economic inequality in our city for many reasons, and in recent years the primary reason has been that our city government works for its business and developer donors, rather than for its people. It takes one look at our recent funding priorities to see why our racial and economic disparities continue to grow.  It has long been said that budgets are moral documents, and the decision of our DC Council to take a budget surplus and distribute it to corporations and the ultra-rich is a statement of morals and values that I will never support. As a Democrat, I was beyond disappointed when the DC Council aligned with some of the same tax policies in 2017 as Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, and dismayed that the current Ward 6 councilmember voted in favor of these cuts. Those votes don't reflect the views or values of my neighbors in Ward 6, they reflect Republican votes that were taken at the behest of wealthy campaign donors.  In concert with his votes to cut the corporate tax rate, slash the estate tax, and give hundreds of millions of tax-payer subsidies to developers, the current Ward 6 councilmember has voted against eliminating the tipped minimum wage, and against new funding for programs that serve those experiencing homelessness and the need to bring new, affordable housing. As a result, in Ward 6 there are shiny new buildings everywhere, yet few truly affordable housing units in sight. Our ward has fewer rent-controlled apartments than any other ward in the city. We welcome fancy new restaurants and stores almost daily, none of which are bringing jobs that are hiring our local workers and paying them a living wage. Our ward is rapidly gentrifying, and while the political establishment remains comfortable with the status quo and cozy with their long-standing developer and business interests, we've somehow arrived at a place where we will turn a blind eye to the displacement of our Black and Latinx neighbors simply because there's a Trader Joe's and Whole Foods for us to shop at. We are better than this. A continuing failure to acknowledge the problem with displacement of our neighbors is why economic and racial inequality continues to grow in our city.  I am frustrated by the myopic lens the current Ward 6 councilman uses in addressing the needs of income inequality and chronic homelessness. It is short-sighted and unsympathetic. He will tell you that he's invested millions of taxpayer dollars in creating affordable housing units across the Ward. Unfortunately, he won't tell you the number of longtime Ward 6 residents displaced from their homes in order to create such “affordable” housing. He won't disclose that those new units are made with sub-standard finishes, and that residents using vouchers to live in them are denied amenities available to non-voucher residents (e.g., the Hine project at Eastern Market). I am deeply troubled by the number of stories I've heard about developers coming into communities to bulldoze existing housing for longtime residents, promising newly-built affordable units to those same residents upon completion, only to expedite the displacement of our neighbors without any intention of helping them return. That's wrong, and yet there is little incentive for my opponent to conduct oversight or even enforce the laws that would protect these tenants, because many of these predatory developers are high-dollar donors to his campaign.  We must address these issues by electing leaders who are committed to elevating, strengthening, and empowering all Ward 6 residents, regardless of whether they can afford to donate to campaigns or attend fundraisers. This starts by electing those who are unencumbered by their relationships to corporate interests. Leadership means engaging in difficult and honest conversations about the realities of a rapidly gentrifying community. It means showing up, and not waiting for people to come to you for support when it's too late, but anticipating the needs of those who are at risk of homelessness and working tirelessly to help those experiencing homelessness get achieve economic and housing security as swiftly and compassionately as possible. It also means making significant investments in affordable housing programs like Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), Targeted Affordable Housing (TAH), Local Rent Supplement Program (LRSP) tenant vouchers for families, and expanding the Rapid Rehousing program.  We have to stop talking about homelessness and housing in a vacuum, and focus on the bigger picture to truly effectuate change in our communities. Recent coverage of a new report by the D.C. Interagency Council on Homelessness revealed that three out of four women in the District who are homeless and living without children are survivors of violence. Based on a survey of 882 homeless women living alone in the District, at least one third said that violence is the cause of their homelessness or housing instability, with 29 percent reporting they had engaged in “survival sex” to obtain money, food, alcohol, drugs, a place to stay or other goods. These are horrifying statistics. As someone who has worked in women's shelters, staffed a sexual assault and rape crisis hotline, and accompanied survivors of domestic violence seeking restraining orders against their abusers to court, I have seen the wretched cycle of violence firsthand. We must elect leaders who will advocate on behalf of these vulnerable populations, understand the role that violence and trauma plays in housing instability, and focus on the social services that protect survivors of violence. If elected, I would champion these issues with a comprehensive view that includes fighting for additional funding to create more beds in the District for women and children fleeing violence, investing in mental and behavioral health services, and supporting organizations providing legal services to our most vulnerable populations.  Ward 6 residents are tired of hearing our councilmember pay lip service to the importance of these issues while we have neighbors living in fear of displacement every day, families living in their cars, and tented communities sprouting up across the city. We just had an opportunity to use a budget surplus that could have improved our current homeless shelter, added educational, health and training programs, continued the process of closing DC General by expediting construction on other facilities, eliminated strict rules on admission standards and maximum stay requirements imposed on our shelters, subsidized construction of additional affordable housing, expanded programs that subsidize living expenses for low-income residents living in subsidized housing, or any number of other things. Any one of those policies could have helped people, but our DC Council decided to put that money into tax cuts for the wealthy. Homelessness and access to affordable housing are complex problems that cannot be solved overnight, but a good start would be immediately moving to repeal those tax cuts and use the money to help people who desperately need it. We have the money, we're just choosing to spend it elsewhere.]"

      "question": "How would you support using the District's current budget surplus? If in the future the District falls into recession creating budget gaps in the $200-400 million range, what would you propose doing then?",
      "response": "[I would use the budget surplus to fund construction of and subsidies for safe, affordable housing for our residents who are currently being ignored. In addition to facing a shortage in stock, our public housing buildings are in need of long-overdue repair. I have spent substantial time getting to know neighbors in Ward 6 public housing, and without exception I have met great, hardworking, caring people, who are dedicated to their community and to their city, but whose city government doesn't appear to be dedicated to them. It's time for that to end.  I would also use the surplus to fund basic public health programs that are not being funded. The DC Council regularly passes legislation, and celebrates themselves for doing so, but then fails to fund the law, implement it, or conduct oversight to ensure compliance. For example, it's long past time we spend an estimated $3 million per year to fund the tampon tax exemption law that was passed in 2016, the delay of which harms thousands of low-income women throughout the city. It's long past time we fully fund the DC paid family leave law, and seek to expand the policy from 8 weeks of leave, the amount the business community would settle for, to 12 weeks of leave, which is the amount doctors recommend. It's long past time we dedicate meaningful funding to address the maternity health crisis in our city, rather than simply earmarking $80,000 to study a problem we already know exists.  During the last recession, our low-income neighbors took the hit, while the business interests in our city continued to thrive. Construction continued at a rapid pace, greatly exceeding anything seen anywhere else in the nation during that time. Business and restaurants opened on a daily basis. If we were to face a similar economic downturn, my priority would be protecting residents, and if a budget gap needed to be closed, I would propose an increase to the corporate and estate taxes, and a freeze on taxpayer subsidies for commercial development, in order to do so.]"

      "question": "Do you support Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) along U.S. 29, including the proposal to extend dedicated lanes south of New Hampshire Avenue into downtown Silver Spring, even if this means removing or narrowing general purpose lanes in some locations?",
      "response": "Yes. As chair of the Council's Transportation, Infrastructure, Energy & Environment Committee, I was proud to have sponsored a study of the “Emerson proposal,” from Four Corners resident Sean Emerson, which will look at the concept of narrowing existing travel lanes on US 29 south of New Hampshire Avenue in order to accommodate median dedicated BRT lanes. The study will also look at pedestrian safety and bicycle infrastructure needs in this corridor.    While County Executive Leggett's US 29 project is a good start, it does not include dedicated BRT lanes south of New Hampshire Avenue, which happens to be the most congested section of US 29.  Without at least one dedicated BRT lane through this section, we cannot truly call this system BRT.  While at least one of my competitors for County Executive has sought to delay the mere study of the Emerson proposal, I have consistently fought for it, even asking our MCDOT to find money in its existing FY 18 budget to do it.    MCDOT has found that funding and it is time to move forward on this exciting concept. I would look to continue design and implementation progress on BRT in this corridor and throughout the County if I have the privilege of serving as our next County Executive.  I understand that dedicated bus lanes are a crucial component to “true” BRT that results in more time savings for riders and attracts “choice” riders.  My overarching goal is to achieve nothing less than a world class transit system for our residents.      With respect to road narrowing, I was the lead sponsor on the new urban road code, which called for road narrowing, among other things, as a way to reduce the number of pedestrian fatalities, among other reasons.  I do not fear road narrowing, and our residents should not either.  We must use our existing road capacity more efficiently.  Reducing lane widths to accommodate a reversible, dedicated BRT land is precisely the results we should be seeking."

      "question": "Are you committed to implementation of Vision Zero (zero traffic deaths)? What is the most important change to the roadways, law, or DOT practices that could bring about Vision Zero?",
      "response": "Yes. I was the co-lead sponsor of the Council resolution that instructed the County Executive branch to develop the Vision Zero Two-Year Action Plan and its implementation would be one of my foremost transportation and public safety priorities as County Executive.    I came to sponsor Vision Zero in Montgomery County after a series of tragic pedestrian, bicyclist, and driver deaths in Bethesda – my Council district. But these crashes are happening everywhere throughout our County and, according to the statistics, our lower-income and immigrant communities are most at risk. Besides the 41 action items in the Vision Zero Two-Year Action Plan, and the action items that will come in a broader Action Plan to take us to 2030, we have to institute a culture change in Montgomery County.  We are unique among most Vision Zero jurisdictions in that we are very suburban in nature.  That can no longer be used as an excuse for some of the excessive vehicle speeds permitted on our roadways and the design choices that lead to those speeds.    The most important single change to getting to our Vision Zero goal will be breaking down the barriers we have traditionally faced from the State Highway Administration (SHA). Fifty-three percent of severe and fatal collisions from 2012 to 2016 occurred on state roadways.  It can no longer be the case that we must wrestle with SHA for needed engineering changes or innovative solutions such as pedestrian-activated crosswalk signals on an intersection-by-intersection basis.  As County Executive, I would make it clear to SHA and the Maryland Department of Transportation that our County's priorities have changed from getting the most possible vehicles through an intersection to first and foremost ensuring safe travel speeds and safe roadways.  I would ensure that the leadership for the County Department of Transportation in my administration supports those values 100% and pushes the state to change its outdated interpretations of the FHWA's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (a frequent obstacle to safer solutions)."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "I would prioritize new transit (BRT network with dedicated BRT lanes and the Corridor Cities Transitway); MARC expansion at Boyds, Germantown, and White Flint; two peak-direction high-occupancy toll lanes on I-270 and I-495 west of the I-270 spur all the way to and over the American Legion Bridge; and efficiency improvements to our existing roads such as state-of-the-art traffic signal sensors, reversible peak lanes to maximize our existing road capacity, and “microtransit” ridesharing services to help make those first-mile/last-mile connections to the rest of the transit network.  Some of these projects (MARC expansion, CCT, I-270 and I-495 improvements) would require state approval and funding.  Others (certain BRT corridors and efficiency improvements to existing roadways) may require state approval, but could be accomplished largely or exclusively through county funding.    I do not believe expensive, but limited new road projects such as M-83 and Montrose Parkway East (the latter at least for now) are the best use of our limited funds – especially if our goal is to embrace multi-modal options that seek to decrease the use of cars."

      "response": "Yes.  I believe in transit-oriented residential communities.  I rent and live in a multifamily building near the White Flint Metro station.  I also believe that when it comes to the candidates to be the next Montgomery County Executive, I am clearly the best positioned to help reconcile the inevitable pushback we will get from those opposed to multifamily, transit-oriented development and the need for these units to improve housing affordability and grow economic prosperity for all without further increasing property taxes.  I have been in these battles.      As the councilmember for District 1 for three terms, I have navigated some of our County's fiercest land-use debates.  I have the scars to prove it.  To say not everyone came out satisfied would be an understatement.  I sacrificed politically for what was right.  And I always worked with community leaders and dove into the details of density, height, and neighborhood compatibility to find common ground and build as much consensus as possible for new multifamily zoning in Bethesda, White Flint, Chevy Chase Lake, and Westbard. This is zoning that has and will continue to increase our affordable housing stock and take advantage of Metro (and eventually, of the Purple Line and BRT).  I believe the next County Executive must have the ability to bring both sides of this debate together – or else we risk losing all momentum on transit-oriented development and fall backward as a county.

The mechanism to facilitate these tools is already in place – the county's new Green Bank, which I was happy to sponsor as a councilmember and will continue to support as County Executive.  The Green Bank will soon be putting into place a low-risk financing product with loans from $10,000-$250,000 for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements to existing multi-family building owners.

      "question": "Many Montgomery County candidates say they want to see more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions. Whose voices do you think are under-represented now, and why? What would you do to help those voices be heard?",
      "response": "I think it is clear that many communities in Montgomery County – low-income, minority, and immigrant communities in particular – are underrepresented in our land use deliberations.  That is not surprising.  These communities do not have the same grounding in the arcane and time consuming world of land use, they do not have the same availability of time, they are working longer hours, and they are more focused on what is before them in their lives day to day.  We hear mostly from established civic organizations and their leaders who have been involved in land use issues for decades and are sophisticated advocates.      I believe it has been part of my responsibility, a responsibility I feel I have met, to assess and act on what I conclude is in the larger public interest, taking into account the “unheard” voices.  That, or course, is a subjective judgement, as is much of our work. I am prepared to be judged accordingly.      But of course it would be better to hear the “unheard” instead.  As County Executive, I will go into these communities, and my Administration will go into these communities, on matters that affect them and inform them of the choices we must make and solicit their views.

Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "I support these policies in the new Comp Plan.  In addition to the Comp Plan we need a more holistic approach to incentivizing affordable housing.  We need to define affordable housing based on up to date criteria.  We need data to show what inventory we have and how much additional affordable housing is needed.  We also need to benchmark what other successful cities have done and determine the federal role.   The $100 million in the trust fund is excellent and we need that money to be part of a long term strategy. The role of TOPA needs to be enhanced with an effort to educate tenants and provide pro bono legal assistance to tenants.   We need a clearinghouse of landlords able to rent to low income tenants and a strategy for incentivizing these landlords.   We cannot have all of the affordable housing in one Ward and all Wards must be engaged."

      "question": "What role should the federal government play over the next 15-20 years in addressing Metro's maintenance funding needs and funding ongoing operations? Would you require other changes (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "As a member of the State Senate and the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC), keeping Metro safe, reliable, and accessible is a high priority for me. An important part of doing so is making sure WMATA's capital needs are met. I believe the federal government needs to follow through on funding its final year of PRIIA grants, and should renew the PRIIA to include $1.5 billion for WMATA (to be matched by the participating jurisdictions) over the next 10 years. I also believe the participating jurisdictions need to make continuing commitments to restore Metro to the world-class transit system it can and should be.     In this year's legislative session, I supported legislation to fully fund Virginia's capital commitment to Metro. I do not believe that jurisdictional or federal funding should be dependent on board or labor reforms, especially when it means scapegoating workers and reducing their pay and benefits.     Operations subsidies from localities increase when ridership declines. Given Metro's recent and highly-publicized SafeTrack closures, riders need to be encouraged to return to the system. The federal government can help by reinstating tax incentives for employers that provide transit benefits to employees that were eliminated under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The federal government also must maintain the Federal Government Mass Transit Benefits Program to help make commuting via transit more affordable for Federal employees."

Project decisions should be made based on congestion relief, safety, accessibility, economic development and environmental quality, not on political factors.

Some proposed methods include increased use of public-private partnerships; tolls; selling off public assets like the airports, parkways, or aqueduct; gas taxes; or general taxes. What do you favor and what would you oppose?",
      "response": "During my tenure in the State Senate, I have worked to find a balance in funding for transportation projects. I believe Virginia, in general, leverages public-private partnerships in a way that benefits most Virginians. I would support the federal government using public-private partnerships to build new roads, infrastructure, and much needed improvements. I have supported and will continue to support sustained sources of funding for our transportation projects, including a gas tax floor in Northern Virginia that will keep our taxpayer dollars in Northern Virginia.     I do not support imposing new tolls on existing infrastructure. I am strongly opposed to selling off public assets, especially when it means we will be privatizing assets. My district includes the Dulles Greenway, which is entirely private. It is owned by a for-profit, foreign entity and is subject to ever-increasing tolls over which local elected officials have almost no control. My district also includes Dulles Airport, which is an important economic driver for our region. In addition to the economic problems that would surely arise from any attempt to sell our airports, doing so would clearly cause grave national security concerns, as the most likely purchasers would be foreign entities."

Our firefighters, teachers, deputy sheriffs, and other government employees should not have to live in West Virginia or Maryland and commute into the 10th District. We should be able to provide adequate affordable housing for residents and employees.     In order to make affordable housing easier to attain, I believe we should fund and support HUD's rental assistance programs, the Community Development Block Grant Program, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and Low Income Housing Tax Credits. I also believe the federal government should uphold and expand protections granted in federal Fair Housing laws that ensure all Americans have equal access to housing."

I believe higher density development should be clustered closer to Metro and other transit hubs, and low density be maintained in the areas that are not served by public transportation and do not currently have access to municipal water and sewer.     New or re-developments should follow the “live, work, play” model to the extent possible, to allow for apartment/condo/townhome residential within walking distance of commercial office and retail development, so that people are less dependent on their cars and are better able to walk or bike to destinations that are part of their daily routine."

      "response": "Currently, the Washington Metropolitan Area's transit system is the only major one in country that doesn't have a dedicated source of funding. It is no secret that the state of our transit system is in disarray, with several maintenance, improvements and repairs often being delayed or ceased altogether due to the lack of consistent, permanent funds. I am in support of bondable funding however, we must be sure that each jurisdiction (District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia) are contributing their fair share into order to operate our shared transit system. In terms of other steps, I just want to have the confidence of knowing that the governance over such a partnership will be effective and that neither jurisdiction gets taken advantage of. In terms of funding, perhaps we can scale back some of the funding being proposed for Governor Hogan's road expansion projects and reallocate it towards to this partnership so that we can save as much taxpayer dollars as possible. I would support looking over the budget and identifying budget items of which we can save money on and transfer the money over to this particular project.        "

      "question": "Do you support Governor Hogan's proposed expansion of I-495, I-270, and/or the BW Parkway? Why or why not? With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "Honestly, I don't believe that Governor Hogan's proposed expansion will yield much of a positive result in terms of decreasing congestion. It's like pouring water into a glass to the point that it overflows and then transferring that water over to a slightly wider glass and patting yourself on the back because now you have increased the area for water to settle in the glass but yet, it still just barely hovers below the brim of the glass. According to a 2012 interagency study conducted by state and federal officials, increasing the road to six lanes will likely produce the same or similar congestion levels as we currently have. Officials also made the point that commuters don't just simply end up on these major roads without having to navigate through neighborhood roadways and other local streets which experience congestion as well. The key to easing traffic congestion is improving our public transportation systems, making sure that commuters have the option of whether they wish to drive to work, carpool or rely on public transit. In addition to the obvious win that such a practice would provide in terms of traffic decongestion, it would mean a huge win for the state of Maryland and neighboring jurisdictions in the fight to reduce carbon emissions and decrease our carbon footprint. Maybe we could even offer incentives to commuters who opt for public transportation rather than driving themselves to and from work. As someone who grew up in Southern Maryland, I know that expanding any of these transportation options to Charles County and further south would ease traffic on Branch Avenue, traffic that eventually pours onto the Capital Beltway and/or 295. The average commute time of residents of Charles County is nearly double that of the average US worker. This comes as a result of the lack of a metro connection to Branch Avenue, which forces commuters to either drive to a Prince George's County metro station or take the drive all the way to their place of employment. Additionally, to get back on the topic of congestion specifically, most households in Charles County have at least two vehicles and the next highest category of homes at 3 vehicles. This means that we have two to three vehicles on the road from the same household alone on any given day, with many of these citizens representing the federal workforce and therefore, commuting to Washington, DC and surrounding areas. As an off-campus undergraduate student at Bowie State University, I experienced first-hand, the grueling traffic coming from Waldorf to Prince George's County and beyond. I believe that the Southern Maryland Rapid Transit proposal would have a significant positive effect on the overall traffic problem in our state and I would make this project a top priority. Again, the goal should be reducing the amount of vehicles on the roads, not simply pouring billions of dollars into widening roads which will only spread out the congestion across a few more lanes and continue to clog up local roads as well."

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "The short answer is yes. As with any growing community and especially one with such vast expansion in such a short period of time, it is extremely important as lawmakers not to get so side-tracked and enamored with the thought of increase in revenue that we forget our single most important responsibility; listening to the will of the people who we serve and making responsible, selfless decisions that will improve their quality of life without marginalizing a portion of that population, treating them as if they are expendable. We have seen this practice communities across the nation which our neighbors in the District of Columbia serving as a prime example. Developers are pouring into our communities and driving property values up which forces low-income residents out of their homes and communities in search of areas with more affordable housing. Now, I am in no way against growth and any homeowner who can afford to maintain their home comfortably despite increases in property taxes would obviously be elated with the idea of knowing that the value of their homes could be considerably higher than they were at closing but, I just don't want us a decision makers to forget that there are living, breathing people who are directly affected by the decisions we make. Some of them will benefit from higher cost of living and some will struggle and we must always make it a priority to engage each income bracket to try and understand how we can address the needs of our wealthiest, upper and lower middle class, and our equally important lower-income residents.

How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Not only would I like to see these three jurisdictions collaborate, I think it would be irresponsible not to. The Washington Metropolitan area as a collective body is one of the most prosperous economies in the nation and the affairs of each jurisdiction certainly affects their neighbors. Every year and especially during election cycles, the discussion of jobs dominates the headlines. Although job creation is crucial to the sustainability and growth of any community, modernizing the transportation system by establishing more metro stops, which would increase accessibility to these new places of work and heighten revenue in the process. This must be done while respecting the concerns of area residents, especially those residing in areas that would be directly affected by the construction of a new line and/or stop. In regards to Amazon's HQ2 bid, I think it would be a great loss of an opportunity if we as a state didn't take an aggressive approach to bringing Amazon to Maryland. I am also open to the idea of a new NFL stadium being built however, there needs to be an agreed upon mandate, specifying that the stadium must employ a certain amount of Maryland residents with a special emphasis on residents of Prince George's County."

      "response": "Yes.  As a member of ACT (the Action Committee for Transit), a board member of Purple Line Now, and a leader in the Sierra Club Energy Committee, I have long advocated for full, dedicated funding for public transit.  Last week, I was lobbying in Annapolis again as part of the Sierra Club Lobbying night, where I advocated for SB277/HB 372 for long-term, dedicated capital funding for the DC-area Metro system, with funding to come from the Maryland Transportation Trust Fund."

With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "As a longtime transit advocate, I strongly oppose Governor Hogan's highway expansions.  Highway expansion leads to more cars, more sprawl, and more traffic.  I would instead dedicate funding to public transit, creating walkable communities, and supporting smart growth that allows people to live close to work or near public transit.      As a Howard University professor, I also note that transportation money spent on highways is funding that is spent on the fraction of the population who often drive in their own cars, which is not representative of the whole population.    As a Montgomery County firefighter and EMT, I have responded to too many 911 calls and accidents on the Beltway.  Widening highways is a dangerous misuse of funds."

Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "I have a decade-long pubic track record of pushing, prodding, and sometimes fighting SHA to get the agency to expand its narrow focus on auto throughput.      As President of the Silver Spring Advisory Board and Chair of the Transportation and Pedestrian Safety Committee, I successfully forced a reluctant SHA to make pedestrian improvements to some of the many state-controlled roads in Silver Spring and Takoma Park, including Georgia Ave., Coleville Rd., East-West Highway/Philadelphia Ave., and others.      More recently, I successfully organized meetings between SHA and MCDOT to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety at the crossing of Rt. 29 (SHA) and Sligo Creek Parkwya (MCDOT).  As a result of my efforts, that community will now have extended crossing times, better lighting, better signage, and an improved crosswalk.    But it should not take such special efforts to make SHA responsive to community needs.  I want to serve on the House transportation committee overseeing SHA so that we can make the legislative changes necessary to the agency.  Those changes include a greater focus on pedestrians and bicycles, and required public input from local communities."

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "As a dedicated public transit supporter, I have supported the Purple Line for over a decade.  Many of my friends and colleagues -- the Sanders family comes to mind -- have been working on it for decades longer.   Part of smart growth includes higher density and thoughtful development near public transportation.      I support efforts to help local businesses near the Purple Line, many of which will otherwise suffer during construction.  I also support greater protection for renters and expanded MPDU requirements so that working families can afford to live near public transit. For example, the current 12.5% MPDU requirement in Montgomery County is inadequate.  Under the current plan, developers of a 200-unit building in downtown Silver Spring have to provide 25 MPDUs, but there is no restriction on what those MPDUs are.  So developers naturally choose their efficiency apartments to be MPDUs in order to maximize profits.  The result is that fewer working families can live there, because they need multi-room dwellings.  Expanding MPDU requirements therefore means more than simply expanding the base percentage."

      "response": "Yes.  Communities should cooperate to bring assets to the region.  Lack of cooperation is what led to our lack of dedicated funding for Metro.  Unthinking competition will see jurisdictions try to outbid each other and go low to try to attract a football stadium or large employer.

      "question": "Prince George's County is the most dangerous in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. Why do you think this is? Is there a role for you in changing this?",
      "response": "It is unacceptable that Prince George's County is the most dangerous county in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. In District 2, where I serve as the County Council representative, we have the intersection with the most pedestrian deaths in the entire State of Maryland, New Hampshire Ave and University Blvd. I also have the district with the greatest density in the County though many of these areas are unincorporated. Until I arrived on the Country Council, previous councils emphasized car ridership, ignoring the built infrastructure changes needed to address the critical concerns for enhancing pedestrian safety and promoting alternative transportation.      I believe the Prince George's County Council has an incredible role to play in making it easier for pedestrians to walk and for cyclists to ride. Since my arrival on the County Council, we have finally opened through MTA the Takoma Park/Langley Park Transit Center to minimize the pedestrian accidents at New Hampshire Ave and University Blvd. This transit center combines 11 bus lines and is the future stop along the Purple Line. The County also spearheaded with the help of the County Council the Capital Bike Share program. This program will help individuals in the last mile of their commute. I am pushing for SHA and MTA to build the Purple Line to include bike lanes along the roadways. In my district, at every opportunity to redevelop and infill the built space, we are advocating to integrate bike share lanes like we are doing along MD-500 (Queens Chapel Rd from East-West Hwy to the DC borderline) to address cyclist safety."

      "response": "I fully support extending The Bus service hours to better match what is provided by other jurisdictions.

Many of my residents have multiple jobs or jobs that require them to commute during non-traditional work hours.  "

Research shows that the widening of roadways causes more congestion and a greater reliance on car transportation, thus promoting an excessively car-based culture. I am not in support of sprawl development projects along the central and southern part of the County. I am in favor of protecting the rural tier of the County and I think the County should discourage sprawl.

I am working with local and national community investment leaders as well as the County Executive to ensure that we put money in the Housing Trust Fund as well as ask the General Assembly to provide bridge loans to small businesses along the Purple Line.

It is critical that we include either some type of inclusionary zoning option or an incentive plan for affordable housing units within the Transit Centers per Plan 2035. To address evictions from illegally rented units I proposed a relocation bill that would charge the landlord for three months of the new rent in the case of an eviction. However, the bill was stalled in committee. I will reintroduce the bill and push for a more favorable response. In the interim, I have worked with county agencies to ensure we have relocation resources available to tenants to protect them from displacement. In terms of foreclosures, I am pushing that we continue to invest in foreclosure prevention programs."

However, it can be abused.  The reality is that ADUs are already well in use throughout my district and realtors are selling single family homes with the advertisement that investor can rent to multiple families at once within R-55 single family home zones.  This has created an overcrowding problem in my district that in turn has destroyed the fabric of some of our communities. As a result, I was forced to pass an overcrowding bill that limited number of dwellers per square feet.  I think ADUs can and should be used but we need to provide adequate oversight to avoid unsafe residential conditions due to overcrowding and poor property standards."

Congressman John Delaney of MD-06 is proposing massive infrastructure projects to be funded by the sale of private bonds. This type of funding should be considered at the state level before we move to raise fares or parking rates.

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "With our traffic congestion any or all options are required to make traffic move. Of course we look towards to state for funding. All these transportation projects are complimentary to each other. My priorities will be somewhat like this:    a. Widening of I-270 & I-495  There is an urgent need to ease traffic on these main arteries.     b. Bus Rapid Transit  Once I-270 and I-495 are widened, the toll way lanes can be quickly used to for BRT while the BRT network will be laid out thereafter.    c. CCT  It is another necessary system to support alleviation of traffic congestion.    d. MARC expansion  Of MARC will play another important role in parallel with Metro. We wish Metro could go beyond its current end points but MARC expansion may not involve regional approval cycles.    e. M-83  It is a hot potato issue. I think people in Clarksburg area do need outlets down south besides I-270. Different options are in play and communities must come together and decide on which option must be picked.    f. Montrose Parkway East  Since it will serve pretty local traffic, it carries less urgency but certainly needed to relieve surrounding highways of heavy traffic.    We know all these projects cannot be started simultaneously. We will take any funds state can provide for I-270 and I-495. I will be championing putting in stiff controls on cost and schedules to save as much as we can and spend some money on BRT and/or any another priority, feasibly. We will work with our congressional delegation to work on Federal funding as well. Also, we need to put stiff controls to save money from current County budget.

I will also hire staff from those communities to directly connect with them more frequently. I will encourage the staff to be practical liaisons.

      "response": "In general I support implementation of Vision Zero, but I do have questions about its details.  For example, in the County's action plan it is noted that the County has already retimed certain traffic lights to allow for more pedestrian roadway crossing time, but the rest of the action plan does not seem indicate that crossing time has been implicated to any significant degree in pedestrian injuries or fatalities. I raise this question because light timing does potentially affect traffic congestion. In any case, the biggest obstacle I see to implementation of Vision Zero by the County is the fact that many of our most dangerous roads fall under state jurisdiction. Maryland has its own program for reducing traffic injuries and fatalities called Towards Zero Deaths. While an online look suggests that the state's program has not advanced very much, perhaps it could provide a vehicle for the County to have a larger voice with respect to safety changes on state roads.

      "question": "Montgomery County has many proposed transportation projects, including a county-wide Bus Rapid Transit network, the Corridor Cities Transitway, MARC expansion, widening of I-495 and I-270, Midcounty Highway (M-83), Montrose Parkway East, and more. With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "I would prioritize these and other projects based on consideration of both standardized and subjective criteria.     Standardized criteria include relative cost and relative projected changes in vehicle miles travelled (VMT), person throughput, travel time improvement, transit mode share and intersection failure. The importance of cost, person throughput and travel time are obvious. Vehicle miles travelled and transit mode share are particularly relevant to environmental considerations (e.g. lowered VMT generally indicates lowered air emissions).  Subjective criteria include perceptions of equity and potential environmental harm that is not as easily subject to standardized comparative measurement.  Standardized and subjective criteria inform funding decisions, but judgment is ultimately required.     M-83 provides an example of how I would apply these criteria to a real world situation.  The Midcounty Corridor Study Supplemental Report dated February 10, 2017 (the “Study”) compares alternatives for improving travel between the Clarksburg area and the Shady Grove area. The report compares three scenarios to a no-build scenario.  Scenario 1 consists of BRT on route 355 plus certain intersection improvements and road widenings. Scenario 2 consists of BRT on Route 355 plus a new reversible 2 lane road generally referred to as M-83, and Scenario 3 consists of a 4 lane non-reversible version of M-83 without BRT.     The people of Clarksburg have been promised improvement in down-County travel through various planning documents and statements by planners and elected leaders over the years. Thus, as a matter of equity and consistent with other priorities, transportation improvement is warranted.     Table  2-2 of the Study compares the performance of Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 across standardized criteria other than cost. It shows that Scenarios 1 and 2 are roughly comparable with each other in travel time improvement (depending upon where one lives), transit mode share and intersection failure.  Scenario 2 has better person throughput, and Scenario 1 has better VMT.  However, going beyond the Study, Scenario 2 would result in new crossings of sensitive stream valleys and wetlands and is projected to cost roughly twice as much as Scenario 1. On balance, therefore, Scenario 1 seems to be the best choice for improving transportation between Clarksburg and the Shady Grove area."

      "response": "To me it is axiomatic that smart growth should implement transit-oriented development, including greater residential housing density near mass transit – particularly for lower income residents who are more likely to rely on transit. For that reason I support streamlining the multi-family housing approval process, but that should not occur at the expense of running roughshod over local neighborhood concerns.  Royce Hanson's book Suburb chronicles the history of development in Montgomery County.  The lesson of Suburb is that development has worked best when there is a balance between the economic imperatives of development and the concerns of people who live nearby. The process of achieving that balance can be maddening and slow, but it results in a more durable political consensus moving forward.  History shows that when balance is not achieved the result has been political overreaction and a swing to the extremes of no-growth policy or unconstrained building – neither of which are in the public interest.

      "response": "The Rental Housing Study lays out a series of policy recommendations for closing the gap in the areas of MPDUs, Land Use/Zoning, Preservation and Finance.  http://montgomeryplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RentalHousingSheet.pdf.    I support detailed consideration of all these measures for purposes of implementation.  Some of them are already the subject of pending legislation before the County Council (e.g. required payment into the Housing Initiatives Fund for projects less than 20 units which are currently exempted from MPDU requirements). As many of these measures require additional funding I am particularly interested in the proposed measures that relate to finance.    Apart from governmental programs, I think it's important to remember that we don't get to repeal the laws of supply and demand.  The Rental Housing Study points out that only 14% of Montgomery County rental housing has been built since 2000, and 55% was built before 1980. If we build more housing, rental prices will come down.  This is true even if the new housing is not originally built for the low or moderate income market because the target market of housing often transitions over time in accordance with demand and the age of the housing stock. While I am not suggesting that the County allow unconstrained housing construction, I do think that the overall impact of housing supply is often lost in the discussion of housing affordability."

      "question": "Many Montgomery County candidates say they want to see more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions. Whose voices do you think are under-represented now, and why? What would you do to help those voices be heard?",
      "response": "I believe that the most under-represented voices on land use and transportation decisions are young people, renters and lower income residents.  They are under-represented because relative to homeowners and specific interest groups such as PTAs, civic associations and environmental organizations they have not made their voices heard.   In the case of young people and renters the lack of strong participation in public discourse seems to stem from a sense of not having a permanent stake in the outcomes of County decisions. Young people are increasingly mobile and often unsure of where they'll be a year into the future.  While some renters reside in the same place for decades, a new rental is always possible.   By comparison homeowners knows that they will be affected by local decisions, and a substantial part of their personal wealth is typically tied up in their homes.  In the case of lower income residents I believe that the struggle to make ends meet tends to crowd out all other uses of time.  My point about young people, renters and lower income residents only relates to overall levels of public engagement.  There are of course organizations that speak wholly or partially to their interests such as the Montgomery County Renters Alliance in the case of renters or CASA in the case of lower income Latino residents. In addition, my belief that these groups are under-represented is unscientific and based solely on my observations over time.  I could be wrong.  If elected to the Council I don't think it would be feasible (or appropriate) for me to attempt to create voices where none exist. Authentic representative organizations can't be manufactured and should arise organically. But if I'm right that young people, renters and lower income residents are under-represented in land use and transportation decisions, I will pay special attention to their concerns and ensure that the positions of the organizations that do speak for them (including often GGW) get appropriate consideration.

      "response": "There is a crisis of affordable housing.  Over the last decade 12,000 units of affordable housing have been lost.  Larger multifamily units are in short supply.  ARHA's public housing is absolutely vital.  We should continue to respect resolution 830 and maintain at the very least the units for very low-income peoples.  One thing we may want to consider is maintaining the same number of bedrooms but creating more two and three bedroom apartments since family sizes are generally shrinking.   Furthermore we need a range of affordability to accommodate a mix of incomes such as young professionals, service industry workers, teachers, first responders, and seniors.  We want to see more and more people who work in the city, live in the city.  This builds community, reduces traffic and supports  the diversity of class (and presumable race) that attracted many of us to Alexandria.

In addition, we occasionally receive developer contributions (in lieu of actual units) and the City directs general funds to the housing trust fund. We have also work closely with non-profit partners to develop or rehabilitate affordable housing projects. In general, I am opposed to dedicated sources of funding in the budget process because it sets one department or issue above others.

Our public rights-of-way are a critically important resource which we need to use in the most efficient manner possible- increasing both the number of people that can be accommodated as well as the modes of transportation available. Clearly a bus which carries multiple people in a contained space is more efficient than numerous single occupancy vehicles, but travelers will have no incentive to switch their mode of travel if the bus is no faster than a car.  Therefore, dedicated lanes are very important.  At the same time, expanding the current right-of-way could have significant impacts on surrounding properties, so I would be more inclined either to narrow existing lanes to accommodate BRT or even to repurpose travel lanes for transit in order to provide frequent, reliable bus service that will help both transit riders and vehicle drivers alike."

To truly implement the policy, we have to take a broad, neighborhood approach rather than merely focusing on isolated crossings and places where fatalities have already occurred.  Efforts to envision ways of implementing the Vision Zero policy in large areas of the county are already underway. The recent Veirs Mill Corridor Master Plan, extending approximately four miles from Rockville to Wheaton, for example, offers recommendations to improve pedestrian and bicycle accessibility, connectivity and safety within the plan area. Similarly, the Forest Glen/Montgomery Hills plan, now underway, is considering changes to Georgia Avenue to improve pedestrian safety.  Probably the most important change we could make would be to reduce vehicle speed, as we have done in denser areas of the county.

      "response": "As executive, I would support zoning changes that would allow smaller multi-family projects to bypass planning board approval to streamline development, but larger projects still merit a more thorough review by planning staff and the planning board to ensure that moderately priced dwelling units (MPDUs) are well distributed and that the buildings are providing sufficient facilities and amenities to support the needs of future residents.     Currently, in transit accessible areas, much has already been done to promote reduced parking requirements. The new zoning code approved in 2014 currently allows for reduced parking in areas near transit and for affordable units. The zoning code also allows a reduced parking requirement for projects that have unbundled parking, i.e. when you buy or rent a unit, you have to pay for a parking space should you wish to have one.  In the C/R (Commercial/Residential) and employment zones, up to 10 public benefit points are given for projects providing fewer than the maximum allowed number of parking spaces, where a maximum is applicable."

      "question": "The county's recent Rental Housing Study noted that 38% of the rental housing demand is from households below 50% AMI, but only 19% of housing is affordable at that level. How would you like to see the county close this gap?",
      "response": "The Rental Housing Study outlined a number of revenue neutral ways that could target households below 50 percent of AMI that I would support. The first is split affordability targets, which would allow for a higher percentage of affordability overall (15 percent compared to the current 12.5 percent for affordable units), but this could be met by providing 5 percent at 50 percent of AMI and 10 percent at 80 percent of AMI.  This would help ensure that providing affordable housing remains revenue neutral to the developer while better meeting our housing needs.      The second is to implement a sliding scale MPDU program, which allows the county to target the different affordability needs in of different sub areas throughout the county. Both development costs and rents can vary significantly depending on where a project is being built.  For example, if a project today has a standard set aside of 12.5 percent at 65 percent of AMI, a sliding scale might only require a 10 percent set aside if housing is provided that serves those at 50 percent of AMI in Silver Spring or a 9 percent set aside  if the project serves those making 50 percent of AMI in Aspen Hill  Developers would have a menu to choose from, but would need final approval from Department of Housing and Community Affairs and Planning Staff.    The county also needs to increase the use of land it owns to provide more affordable units. For example, the Bonifant, a senior housing project built on County-owned land in Silver Spring, has only 10 market-rate units, while 58 units are reserved for seniors earning less than 50 percent of AMI, and 81 units are set aside for those earning less than 60 percent of AMI.  Such projects, which are creative and can target our greatest affordability needs county-wide, should not only be used to provide senior affordable housing but also for affordable housing projects serving the broader population."

      "question": "Which proposal do you support for the redevelopment of the old Silver Spring Library? What do you believe is the best use of the site, and how does that reflect your general approach to new development and redevelopment projects?",
      "response": "Late in February a decision was made to turn the old library into a large daycare center. This is an acceptable solution, given the fact that the county still lacks adequate daycare, the existing building will be saved, and the construction funding is coming from a private source.  The other proposal, which called for the construction of a senior housing project and a daycare center, had both funding and zoning issues.  In general, I am a supporter of both new development and redevelopment projects, particularly in more densely developed areas near transit.  However, as this project shows, our master plans need to be more flexible when it comes to the use of county owned land. The Master Plan called for the former library site to become parkland, enlarging the adjacent Ellsworth Urban Park.  While the area could definitely use more green space, providing more affordable housing is a more pressing priority."

      "question": "Many Montgomery County candidates say they want to see more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions. Whose voices do you think are under-represented now, and why? What would you do to help those voices be heard?",
      "response": "Under-represented groups include Latino residents, now about 20 percent of the county's population, and others who do not speak English as their first language. While some county agencies use translators and translated materials to engage foreign-born and immigrant populations, these efforts are uneven and do not always reach the intended audiences. The Planning Department has also tried many innovative outreach techniques, and these should be expanded.  I would encourage more voices to be heard through broader and more concentrated outreach programs across county agencies to overcome language barriers and cultural differences, and encourage more facilitated public engagement. However, community engagement may not be seen as a top priority by those populations that are struggling to provide for their families."

      "response": "Yes, this is long overdue. Metro is a necessity for the viability of the DC metro region. My legislative District, is home to 2 metro stations and a large number of residents in my District rely on Metro bus and rail to get to work and school every day. I support the bills that are pending in the Maryland General Assembly sponsored by Delegates Marc Korman and Erek Barron. I think it is wise for the State of Maryland to utilize the money from the Transportation Trust Fund. I believe that this is an appropriate use of these funds. However, I want to emphasize that I do believe that a re-examination of the governance and operation of Metro is a necessity and should be a requirement in exchange for the dedicated fund from Maryland. It appears that Metro can operate more efficiently and spend money more effectively insuring that maintenance and repair of the system occurs in a timely manner and properly trained and skilled employees. Metro ridership has decreased because of cut backs in service, safety concerns, and fare increases that dis-proportionally harm those who can least afford alternatives to get to work and school."

With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "No, I do not support Governor Hogan's proposed expansion of I-495, I-270 or the BW Parkway. Past experience has shown that expansion of these roadways will not eliminate traffic and gridlock but will result in more people driving. Additionally, Governor Hogan proposes to install tolls on these lanes to attract the private financing to pay for the cost of the expansion. This is a disastrous and ill-advised proposal. Ask the riders on Northern Virginia about the $35-45 one-way tolls that recently went into effect on I-66. Additionally, there are serious environmental concerns with this proposal such as increased emissions from cars and destruction of forested areas which serves as a habitat for wildlife. Lastly, there are communities next to I-495, I-270 and BW Parkway. Does the Governor proposed to take these homes in order to have the land for expansion of these roadways? As a real estate attorney, I am acutely aware that the region that is already suffering from a housing shortage and such a move will not assist our housing needs and concerns. The Governor should use these funds, instead towards the improvement and expansion of our existing public transportation projects such Metro and MARC."

      "response": "Unfortunately, I do not think that the State Highway Administration (SHA) does a great job of balancing walking, bicycling, car and transit needs. It appears that SHA favors a 1950's model of encouraging fast car movement as much as possible to the detriment of pedestrians and those who wish to bicycle or rely on public transportation.

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Yes. A large portion of the Purple Line will transverse through District 22. The concern that I have heard from a number of residents is gentrification. Many residents and business are worried that they will be come priced out of their homes and that the County will allow high end development that will price out existing businesses. A few months ago, Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker, Montgomery County Executive Ike Legget and University of Maryland President Wallace Loh signed a community agreement titled, “Pathways to Opportunity” that makes commitments to investing on businesses and housing development along the long-awaited Purple Line. The goal of this agreement is to address the concerns raised over the years from homeowners and businesses. However, the agreement is not a legally binding agreement which I think is unfortunate because it is unenforceable if a party fails to live up to their end of the agreement. Because this is a multi-jurisdictional agreement, the State should pass legislation to codify the agreement and provide penalties if either party fails to live up to their end of the agreement."

      "response": "Unfortunately, our State and County road structure were not established to provide safe pedestrian and cyclist usage. Older, urban communities lacked bike lanes. Communities built since the late 1960's have been sprawling and connected by dangerous roadways. With overbearing traffic congestion, many people drive without concern for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. The County has continued to build non-walkable communities, furthering the problem.     When serving as Chair of the County Council Transportation, Housing & Environment Comment for three years,  I led the Council's update of the “Road Code” that requires new development to address pedestrian safety and requires bike lanes. Reconstructed County roads are to provide the same. I also advocated for interconnected bike trails.     I intend to continue to advocate for these policies and use the oversight function to ensure that these policies are implemented on the ground. In addition, I want future sprawl development to be limited, and Metro development and walkable redevelopment incentivized."

      "question": "What is your top economic development priority, and what strategies do you plan to use to achieve it?",
      "response": "Changing the jobs to housing ratio. The County has the worst jobs to housing ratio in the region, which reflects the lack of quality employment in the County.     This situation has been discussed for at least 20 years, and the 2002 General Plan provided strategies to improve the ratio. However, the county government and planning board failed to implement these strategies. Instead, they have followed the path of ad hoc sprawl development projects. Even though the County had an excess of retail space by 2000, its leaders have rezoned quality employment land near major infrastructure for large quantities of big box retail. The County needs to change its development policy to prioritize permits to focused areas near transit, and incentivize quality employment development. There have been successes near the College Park Metro station, and the successes should be replicated at metro stations throughout the County."

      "question": "The county is currently developing a Comprehensive Housing Strategy. What are your goals and priorities for that? How would you combat the problems of evictions and foreclosures?",
      "response": "The County needs to focus on Metro development, including the provision of affordable multi-family housing in close proximity to transit. Limits need to be placed on sprawl development, because it is increasing congestion and a backlog of infrastructure projects.     Communities inside or near the Beltway should be targeted for revitalization projects. The County should work with the targeted municipalities to create mechanisms to enhance revitalization.     Because of changing demographics, the County needs to ensure that future projects provide a greater number of smaller rental units. In addition, the County must make it a priority to provide additional housing for senior citizens, particularly affordable housing.     As a member of the Board of Directors of Laurel Advocacy and Referral Services, Inc. (LARS). This nonprofit organization provides assistance to people in fiscal crisis, including the homeless. My experience with LARS has demonstrated that the State and County do not provide sufficient funding to address the eviction and foreclosure crisis.     The following is a step by step plan as to how we can combat this issue:     First, the County needs to study the extent of the eviction and foreclosure crisis to determine how additional funding could help.     Second, the County has added some jobs under the current administration, but most of these are service jobs that are not highly paid. The County needs to focus its economic development strategy on creating more technical and professional jobs to balance out the workforce.     Third, the County should engage in eviction and foreclosure mediation. The State “HOPE” program is not sufficiently addressing the need in the County.     Fourth, the County Council needs to limit suburban sprawl development because it undermines values of existing homes, many of which are still underwater.     Fifth, the County needs to incentives multi-family housing near transit, particularly smaller units and more affordable units.     Sixth, many HOA and Condo association communities have resale problems due to a high delinquency rate for dues. The County should explore options to assist such communities to address the delinquency rate to enhance resale opportunities.     Finally, the County needs to be more vocal about the regional nature of the affordable housing problem and its impact on eviction and foreclosure. The County has the greatest number of “affordable” units, at the greatest percentage and at the lowest rents or home values of the inner Metro jurisdictions. Hence, the County attracts the most vulnerable families and individuals, and in greater quantity. Because of the vulnerability, the County experiences a higher percentage of crisis situations. The economic divide identified by the Brookings Institution long ago, has not dissipated in any significant way. The County strategy needs to include a public discussion on the need for the State of Maryland and other jurisdictions to recognize the regional need for affordable housing to a greater degree than they have to date."

      "question": "A development review process known as \"call-up\" was previously struck down by the state Supreme Court, but a similar process, known as \"election,\" is proposed in the current draft of the county's zoning rewrite. Do you support including or removing \"election\" in the final zoning code?",
      "response": "It is not my understanding that “call-up” has been struck down by the Court of Appeals. Call-up has been used appropriately, and on occasion and has been abused. My experience with call-up as a citizen and as a councilmember has generally been positive. Generally, it is a helpful tool that can compensate for the lack of familiarity of citizens with the planning and zoning process.     There appears to be a misconception about who call-up should advantage. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the planning board or zoning hearing examiner decision, the applicant's zoning attorney files an appeal. There is no need for a call-up. On the other hand, for opponents, a variety of situations occur that lead to their failure to present a complete case – or any case. In these instances, call-up arguably is appropriate to address the inherent power imbalance in land-use matters.     Call-up has been criticized by the planning board and staff, and by developers. The developers complain about it because it gives citizens who are not familiar with the process the opportunity to be heard when they have failed to become aware of a matter in a timely fashion. Developers complain about lack of certainty, but citizens complain about being seriously disadvantaged in zoning matters in multiple ways. GGW members are generally engaged in land use policy, but such is not the case for average residents. Having served as an attorney for civic associations and individual citizens in land use matters for many years, I am well aware of the lack of knowledge of most residents. And, while there is not an exact correlation, the ability to engage fairly in a land use matter tends to diminish in communities of lower income or a higher degree of immigrants.     With regard to planning board and staff complaints, I respect the concerns of the staff that good planning can be undermined by call-up. However, this ignores other realities of the land use process.     First, the planning board members are appointed by the County Executive traditionally have been very pro-development with limited concern for community impact. For much of the past 15 years, the planning board chair has been a developer attorney. Virtually no citizen in a major case believes that they get a fair hearing before the planning board.     Second, while Prince George's County often has excellent planning staff, it is known that staff is often pressured by the planning department administration to make concessions. This practice undermines arguments that call-up leads to bad planning. Administrative interference also leads to bad planning. This point should be evident in the bad, sprawl development that is strewn around the County. Of course, County Council interference can also hurt. County Council interference occurs in multiple ways (e.g., site-specific text amendments) that are unrelated to the call-up mechanism. As stated above, call-up can be positive or negative.     Third, with respect to specific applications, the planning process involves a number of meetings between staff and applicant representatives. Many compromise decisions are made – to the exclusion of the public. The planning board overwhelmingly supports these compromise positions when residents show up at the planning board hearing. Again, the planning process is not perfect, and is sometimes unfair.     Fourth, with respect to the zoning rewrite project, the principal proponents of retaining call-up are experienced and engaged civic activists --- precisely for the reasons listed above. Apart from their experience with bad planning board decisions, these activists are very concerned about having been stripped of their standing rights. The General Assembly recently changed the standing rules, at the request of developers, such that the ability of citizens to appeal to the District Council is seriously undermined. Thus, call-up may be the only mechanism to get a case before the District Council in the future."

      "response": "I believe this hazard exist for a number of reasons. First, there is traffic congestion due to poor traffic management. Secondly, the streets in many areas are not well maintained or marked. Thirdly, the smaller presence of law enforcement does not discourage unsafe practices. I believe that doing a better job with traffic management by making more crossing signals available. The improved maintenance of streets and better signs to alert motorists to the presence pedestrian and cyclists would be beneficial. Lastly, a better law enforcement and appropriate fines would go a long way to discouraging unsafe actions."

      "response": "My top economic development priority is bringing in more industries that pay citizens a higher rate of pay and keeping property taxes from rising artificially. To lure industries, The New Plan for Prince Georges County would acquire or use currently owned County property to construct industrial business sites. These sites would only require minimal modifications by the industries we bring in. In addition, those that acquire their own facilities and employ more than a hundred full time workers, we would freeze their property taxes.   The convenience of established sites and lower taxes would be nice incentives. Keeping homeowner property taxes at the lowest possible rate also puts more money into the local economy. Finally, cutting waste and placing revenue surpluses into a rainy day fund will help keep taxes stable."

In addition, making sure citizens understand everything about home ownership is crucial. No one told me about the County's three year tax cycle and I almost ended up in a bind because my mortgage increased by over $200 one year. I questioned many in the State as to who should have told me about that. I received no good answer, except the suggestion that maybe my realtor could have said something. Lack of information hurts. I realized that the urban planning in Prince Georges County is not where it should be. I believe that through State and Federal Grants, we must incorporate more low to middle income housing. If the builders are not willing to do so, then the County must be willing to construct and manage such properties."

      "response": "My full time job is located in downtown D.C., and (outside of the legislative session), I take the Metro almost every day to get to work. As a commuter, I have personally experienced many Metro challenges, and I am passionate about finding solutions to make metro safer, more reliable, and affordable for everyone. I participate in a regional collaborative of legislators working to change and improve the Metro system. One of our recommendations is dedicated funding for Metro, which I strongly support. We can achieve this legislatively, such as with HB372, which I have cosponsored. This legislation establishes the Maryland Metro Dedicated Fund Account in the Transportation Trust Fund with $125 million appropriated annually. I believe Metro requires comprehensive solutions, such as governance changes, a strong inspector general, and a more powerful voice for riders. However, I do not require these others steps before supporting dedicated funding."

      "response": "One of the most striking aspects of Governor Hogan's proposed expansion is the lack of collaboration or consultation with a single local public official or constituent. I share the Governor's concern about traffic, which many constituents have voiced as well. However, I believe this lack of collaboration set the foundation for this unworkable plan. Widening the road is not an evidence-based approach to traffic alleviation. The proposal will be high cost for the public and it is step a backward in our community's vision for stronger public transportation infrastructure. With limited public funding, it's imperative that we prioritize MARC, BRT, CCT, the Purple Line, etc. These projects will get cars off the road, alleviate traffic, and decrease our environmental impact.

With the current construction of the Purple Line, I have been working to mitigate the impact with local business such as those located on Bonifant Street, which are majority small, immigrant-owned businesses. Sen. Will Smith and I have introduced legislation that will create a fund to offset loss revenue from construction of the Purple Line. In addition to supporting businesses during construction, I believe we need to understand and anticipate the impact of the project before its finalization. I support legislation that requires an in-depth impact study that progressively measures impacts such as affordability and utilizes evidence-based tools and controls to ensure that communities are not displaced as a result of transit. The Purple Line Compact is an example of how this could work. My proposal would codify these provisions as a part of the plan for the project.   "

      "response": "It's imperative that Maryland, Virginia and D.C. collaborate on issues like transit, housing and economic development. Metro is the clearest example for the dire need for collaboration, especially with identification of dedicated funds. None of our jurisdictions can fix Metro alone and the ridership and governance require a regional approach. Market changes tend to affect the entire region and all jurisdictions are facing the challenge of affordability. When large companies like Amazon make their home in this region, all jurisdictions benefit from the increase in employees and patronage of businesses.

Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "I support some but not all of the changes set forth in the city's proposed Comprehensive Plan. I've seen density be both a positive and negative force in our city's development. Therefore, I want the new Comp Plan to be clearer with regards to the Zoning Commission's powers. This new Comp Plan has loosened density definitions and determined that the Zoning Commission should interpret provisions as a suggestion, as opposed to a requirement. This places the Commission's opinion and authority above the intention of the legislation.      I'm interested in keeping housing affordable for existing owners.  One way to do this is to build enough affordable housing stock to hold down housing inflation and lessen the amount of rent increases that landlords can impose. We can also expand tax deferral programs for seniors.    I support higher density around existing Metrorail stations to ensure that we are making Washington efficiently and effectively planned.  While, as you know, more developable land is on the eastern half of the District, there is no reason why Wards 2, 3, 4 and 6 should not contribute to planned and proposed affordable housing.    I think developing a stronger “right of return” or more generous buyout requirements for tenants in affordable housing locations being redeveloped would be a good idea.  There should be time limits on developers providing the redeveloped housing units, and non- compliance should incur financial penalties that flow to the displaced tenants."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "Bus only lanes work in the highest traffic avenues in DC because the volume of buses doesn't always warrant a fully dedicated lane.  30 buses an hour, which is a lot for DC, means a bus only every two minutes in dedicated lanes.  One way to solve this is to allow charter buses, tour buses, taxis with customers, commercial vehicles and commuter buses to help push the volume up.  H and I Streets downtown have the volume and road capacity for dedicated rush hours lanes and there is general support for the bus lanes that DDOT is planning to build on parts of 16th Street NW.  There are other on-street improvements that could be implemented around town to improve bus flow such as queue jumpers, dedicated left-turn lanes and priority signal timing for buses.    That said, I do support increasing the number of streets with rush hour parking restrictions and widening the time period the restrictions are in effect by one-half hour on the back ends, i.e. until 10 a.m. in the morning and until 7 or 7:30 p.m. in the evening.  Important crossstreets like Irving St. and Columbia Rd. through Columbia Heights that have bus routes, could use rush hour parking restrictions.  The additional capacity would benefit bus riders and auto users.  I am sure there are other streets in the District that would also benefit from initiating rush hour no parking rules.    Bike lanes are an absolute requirement for us in Washington to support the 21st century multi-modal commuter.  DC has a relatively limited street network and it's really messed up by L'Enfant's idea to layer in streets that run on a diagonal to the grid.  Commuting by bike continues to grow.  I'd like to see more bike lanes not on streets with major bus routes but on parallel streets.  There is certainly room to continuing to grow the bike lane network in the District and it should be a more prominent part of our transportation investments."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including $178 million from DC? How would you achieve this? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "I absolutely support bondable funding for Metro.  Increasing the District's sales tax by 1 percentage point is the easiest way to approve DC's share of the $500 million.  Other, more creative options include extending the DC sales tax to ride-sharing companies and establishing transit improvement districts around Metrorail stations in the District where property owners pay higher taxes to reflect the higher value of their property as a result of the Metrorail station.  This tax could apply to all property or just non-residential property in a defined geographic area around the station.  I would also explore the idea charging higher ticketing fees for out-of-state cars to support our transportation infrastructure which they don't pay their fair share to improve.    However, money alone won't solve Metro's problems.  The Board is too big and unwieldy.  It is getting better but it still needs more smart, knowledgeable people who can really spend a lot of time learning about the issues.  So much time has been spent on the money issue and not enough on proper vetting and oversight of the nearly $1.0 billion a year capital program.      While the union needs to negotiate some changes in their benefits to bring them more in line with what other public sector workers get, the LaHood study confirmed that Metro workers' pay and benefits are not that out of line with their peers at other large transit agencies.  Supporting higher employee contributions to the pension fund would be reasonable.  Metro workers have recently begun to contribute 3% of their salary.  The mean is now probably around 6% of salary.  NY has adopted a tiered contribution system where higher paid employees contribute more to the pension fund and lower paid employees contribute somewhat less.  I think that makes a lot of sense."

      "question": "Do you support funding the DC Streetcar to extend east to Benning Road Metro in Ward 7 and west in dedicated lanes to Georgetown? Or, what infrastructure to improve access by District residents to jobs, schools, and businesses would you support funding?",
      "response": "Extending the streetcar east to Benning Road is a pretty easy lift and DDOT and current and former decisionmakers can be rightly criticized for dragging their feet on this extension.  Extending to Benning Road will make the existing route long enough to function as a decent line able to take people places.  DDOT has started design on the extension.  The community is fairly accepting of this extension, too.      Going west is much more complicated.  There are restrictions on overhead wires in the District which means that we have to pick a battery technology.  The technology exists and is starting to be used in other places including the new Detroit streetcar.  Biggest problem is bureaucrats don't want to make decisions.  Going west requires a larger maintenance and storage facility.  There are more locations towards the east like the PEPCO plant.  A streetcar maintenance facility is pretty benign as the engines are electric and don't produce fumes.  If you spend enough money it can look very nice and fit in.    Other infrastructure investments?  We need to replace the aging bus garages in the District.  They are hindering better bus service here.  This will result in some angst, particularly at Northern garage, from people who want to move it.  Problem is nobody wants a bus garage.  Solution, spend enough money to build LEED certified structures as has been done in NYC (northern Manhattan) and other mitigation actions like 14th Street streetscape improvements north and south of the rebuilt garage.  Façade will be kept as it is landmarked.  Bladensburg and Western are the two other garages.  We also need future investment in Metro core capacity improvements.  South Capitol Street bridge Phase I has broken ground.  More stages to come."

      "question": "Last year, the DC Council approved $36 million in tax-increment financing to subsidize 600 additional parking spaces at Union Market. Are you supportive of the way that TIF proceeded or would you like to see changes for future TIFs, regarding parking and/or in general?",
      "response": "This was a pretty crappy decision by the Council but then again I generally oppose building taxpayer subsidized parking.  The problem is not with TIFs, the problem is with the Council's decision-making process.  The process should have been more transparent and included consideration of the community's opinions before approving.  Proponents claim that the existing property owners are paying for the garage with the additional taxes that future development will result in.  Of course the public is providing them with the tax-free bond subsidy, too."

Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "The historic preservation process is unwieldy.  Opponents of development use it as a bludgeon to make redevelopment projects harder to complete.  In Friendship Heights this is underway as opponents of a new bus garage and new commercial development have successfully gotten the façade of an old PEPCO substation on Wisconsin Avenue landmarked.  Just being old is not a sufficient qualification for landmarking or preservation.  Lots of DC is old.  But not a lot of buildings are of profound historical consequence.    I have more mixed feelings about some of the pop-up higher buildings in brownstone or townhouse neighborhoods.  While I think there needs to be away to accommodate growth and renewal, I understand some of the objection to a 5 story building set in a row of 2 or 3 story townhouses."

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "My top campaign priority is addressing the inequities that define different areas of Washington, DC. It's unacceptable that child born on Alabama Avenue Southeast inherently has a slimmer chance at getting a good education and fulfilling their full potential compared to a child born on Massachusetts Avenue Northwest. I was raised on Martin Luther King Jr. Ave Southeast, where my father still lives, and having persevered through the structural barriers of DC I feel profoundly inspired by an obligation to correct what I see as social and political injustices.    Ensuring housing stability for DC's lowest income residents is a top personal and professional priority of mine. As someone who grew up in a working class family, the son of a DC school teacher and an environmental scientist, I know intimately the challenges that many families in DC face. I am personally invested in seeing increased funding to our lowest income residents who are the most at-risk of being priced out of both renting and owning property in DC. As a member of DC Council I will focus on maintaining property taxes for our highest value home-owners and commercial property owners to bridge the funding gap that this program would create.    Better education and higher paying jobs are the longer term solution to homelessness and income inequality. Additionally, there should be severe penalties for landlords who harass law and lease abiding tenants to try and move them out.    As a member of DC Council I will commit to ensuring that homelessness is rare, brief and non-recurring by increasing our financial commitment to the city's permanent housing and wrap-around services that help residents work their way off public assistance and into permanent self-sustainability.     I support investing at least $25 million in the Public Housing Repair Fund. I also believe that there should also be an oversight committee that constantly reviews negligent landlords to pursue litigation if they do not effectively manage their properties. We see the Attorney General's litigation against Sanford Capital which brings up the concerns inherent in our oversight of slumlords in DC. My proposed oversight and review committee would perform consistent reviews of landlords and hold them accountable to residents. This will consequently encourage and support investment in public housing repair on behalf of private owners to stay compliant."

We should spend 40% of our surplus on social services that are intended to permanently fix our issues. Finally, I would suggest that we spend the remaining 40% on road and transportation.    I support expenditures that seek to create financial stability and makes DC a nicer place to live which in turn supports economic opportunity and equality. Additionally, DC still has a long list of assets in poor condition: among those are streets, sidewalks, bridges, schools, fire houses and police departments.  I would also like to see a more profound investment in affordable housing. As a member of DC Council I will be hands-on in ensuring that our housing policies reflect our city's mission to maximize community benefit with every investment and piece of legislation we approve. I intend to conduct independent research, implement the findings and constantly review Council actions to effectively govern our city and best serve in the public interest.  The District's share of Metro capital costs will continue to be a big demand on DC funds, so transportation is also of key importance."

      "question": "Our region shares many things: a transit system, a housing market, even a football team. Would you like to see Maryland, Virginia, and DC collaborate to avoid a race to the bottom? How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Collaboration and cooperation between governments across state lines is key to the economic growth and well-being of communities across the DMV. According to a study, which redrew state lines based on economic ties, current state lines do not represent cohesive communities. Understanding regionalism and the breadth and specificity of the economic factors that are interwoven across state lines is key to achieving partnerships and leveraging data and resources for the benefit of communities and residents. For example, we must understand what economic factors to leverage to influence D.C. and Virginia to invest their share to fund and improve the Metro system. Sharing data to provide comprehensive incentives to attract Amazon's HQ2 is another example of how Maryland, Virginia, and DC should be working together. The governments of all three jurisdictions understand that having Amazon in the DMV would have benefits across state lines as employees could come from any of them; therefore, there should have been and should be moving forward, collaboration to shape bids and other substantial development such as the stadium and Metro expansion."

      "question": "DC is amending its Comprehensive Plan. Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "Yes, I certainly support changes designed to increase the amount of and quality of affordable housing for DC. .The framework of the Comprehensive Plan seeks to clarify and unify the definitions that were previously unclear. For example, all the height limits in the framework were revised to be based off of the zoning tables approved by the Zoning Regulations of 2016 rather than having both stories and feet within the same Plan. I am confident that the District law can work together with the Zoning Commission to achieve a balance and a set of goals for affordable housing and development in the city.     The city possesses an existing array of tools to combat the affordable housing crisis such as the regulatory regime of rent control, the Preservation Fund to leverage public dollars to attract private capital, the Housing Production Trust Fund for the production of new affordable units, Inclusionary Zoning, public housing and homeownership programs. However, as the legislative body, it is the Council's duty to ensure that the legal language of these programs provide a pathway for efficient implementation and that loopsholes are not being created. In order to achieve these goals, I have persevered to author, co-introduce, and move legislation in my Committee during my tenure at the Council that would achieve our goals of creating and preserving affordable housing and strengthening protections for tenants, including the following:    Elderly and Tenants with Disabilities Protection Amendment Act of 2016  Lowers the annual rent increase by the lowest of the Social Security, COLA, or CPI   Various changes to the law for the elderly to remain in their units  Exempts all low-income elderly and low-income tenants with a disability from rent increases due to petitions  Public Housing Resident Bill of Rights Amendment Act of 2017  Establishes a Public Housing Resident Bill of Rights to inform residents of some of their federal and District tenancy rights.  Public Housing Credit Building Pilot Program Act of 2017  Establishes a pilot program that will allow residents in certain public housing properties to volunteer to have the timeliness of their rent payment reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus.  Home Purchase Assistance Program Amendment Act of 2018  Increases the down payment assistance for the lowest income recipient to $100,000 and establishes a minimum amount of assistance provided to those at 120% of the Area Median Income  Rental Housing Registration Update Amendment Act of 2017  Requires housing providers to file registration statements for each housing accommodation for which they are receiving or entitled to receive rent with the Rent Administrator and the registration must be available for public inspection online.  Rental Housing Affordability Re-Establishment Amendment Act of 2017  Establishes baseline rents for units that are no longer exempt from the District's rent stabilization program after a tenant-based subsidy has ended. The bill specifies that the new base rent will be based on the adjustments of general applicability issued during the period the unit was exempted.  Rental Unit Fee Adjustment Amendment Act of 2017  Increases the rental unit fee from $25 to $30 and to deposit the money obtained from the increase into the Department of Housing and Community Development Unified Fund.   Office to Affordable Housing Task Force Establishment Act of 2018  Establish a task force, the Office to Affordable Housing Task Force, which would determine the impact of transition in existing vacant commercial space to affordable units on the District's affordable housing crisis.  Limited-Equity Cooperative Task Force Act of 2018  Establishes a task force to provide comprehensive policy recommendations on how the District can assist in the formation of new limited-equity cooperatives, and how the District can help currently struggling limited-equity cooperatives improve their organizational structures and financial situations in order to become financially healthy cooperatives.  At-Risk Tenant Protection Clarifying Amendment Act of 2017  Authorizes the Office of the Attorney General to enforce the Consumer Protection Procedures Act against housing providers that violate laws that protect tenants.   TOPA Single-family Home Exemption Amendment Act of 2018  Exempts single-family homes from the requirements of the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA), with an exception for elderly tenants at least 62 years old and tenants with a disability, with contracts or leases for units to be occupied by January 15, 2018, and that are signed by December 31, 2017."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "I am in favor of the District's efforts to implement sustainable ways to transport our residents quickly, efficiently, and safely throughout our city streets. Actions that improve bicycle safety in downtown DC that also support efficient automobile movement are consistent with this goal. Protected bicycle lanes improve the environment and the local economy, and they provide a safer means of travel for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians alike.  Protected bicycle lanes have a high cost-benefit ratio, and provide multiple benefits. Significantly, on streets with protected bicycle lanes, bicycle riders suffer up to 90% fewer injuries. Bicycle lanes slow automobile traffic to safer speeds, and get bicycles off of sidewalks where they endanger children, the elderly, and others.  Protected bicycle lanes improve safety for motorists who no longer need to cross into the oncoming traffic lane to avoid bicyclists. The additional space improves drivers' ability to navigate and make quick stops. Motorists are also able to travel at a more consistent speed without the need to slow down for cyclists.  Finally, as District residents would feel safer biking in protected bicycle lanes and encourage more residents to ride bicycles. That said, I also firmly support more accountability among the District's bicycle riding population. While certainly the vast majority of District bicyclists obey District laws and ride safely, some bicyclists flagrantly ignore common sense bicycle rules and regulations, endangering themselves, motorists, and pedestrians. I therefore also support increased fines for violations of traffic laws, and enhanced enforcement of those laws. Finally, I strongly support District policies and programs to encourage all District bicyclist to register their bicycles on the voluntary bicycle registration system administered by the National Bike Registry. By registering their bicycles law enforcement officials are able to access the database to allow for greater success in recovering stolen bicycles.  I also support dedicated bus lanes during morning and evening rush hours, which can reduce District commuters' travel time by millions of hours. Dedicated bus lanes can improve the quality of life in the District by saving travel time, improving traffic safety, reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) and local air pollutant emissions, and increasing physical activity. Dedicated bus lanes reduce asthma and other respiratory problems by reducing air pollution.  In streets with high travel demand, dedicated bus lanes can help move people quickly and provide a viable alternative to individual cars. Dedicated bus lanes separate buses from mixed traffic, which would allow them to travel more quickly throughout the District. Pre-paid boarding and level platforms – similar to those of a metro station rather than the traditional bus stop, facilitate passenger boarding, while traffic signal management that prioritizes buses in dedicated lanes minimizes wait times.  The incorporation of modern fuel efficiency technologies into buses in dedicated bus lanes also contributes to lower fuel consumption and emissions. New state-of-the-art hybrid buses that reduce travel times by 30% means improved air quality and reducing air pollution that causes asthma and other respiratory illnesses.  Dedicated bus lanes are a cleaner, and more efficient mode of transport. Dedicated bus lanes can shorten a 45 minute bus ride into a 30 minute bus ride, which saves time and money for District riders. Dedicated bus lanes would offer District residents a competitive, reliable alternative to individual automobiles, reducing household transportation costs, thereby freeing up more resources for other necessities such as housing and healthcare."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including $178 million from DC? How would you achieve this? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "A report by a panel of regional managers led by our CFO Jeff DeWitt concluded that WMATA has a need of funding of at least $6 billion. DC has proposed a 1% sales tax evenly applied across the entire region to everything. There are other alternatives instead of the 1% regional sales tax such as an added amount to property taxes or an increase in gas taxes. I support the 1% sales tax increase across the region because it is an equitable tax that would be applied to each of the jurisdictions. This is a dedicated revenue source that other jurisdictions use to fund their public transportation systems as well. However, I do not believe that DC must take this burden on alone. Our Metro system affects the livelihood of everyone in the region and each jurisdiction must hold up their end of the deal in order to ensure an equitable and collaborative investment."

      "response": "While I support the DC Streetcar project, I would like to see the route head eastward and connecting with the Anacostia and the Minnesota Avenue metro stations and then head westward past H Street and the bridge into Union Station. The project has suffered from a lack of community buy-in, costs that have greatly exceeded initial estimates, and long delayed timelines. Today, more than 2 years after the Streetcar began operating, there is still no fare collection system. And just this week we learned of concerns regarding the District's ability to obtain replacement parts, which may lead to scrapping the current fleet entirely - well before what should be the end of the cars' lifetime.    The Streetcar was conceived with the goals of fostering economic growth and development in underserved parts of the city and improving transportation infrastructure to improve access to amenities for District residents. I wholeheartedly support these goals, and I do support the planned eastward expansion of the Streetcar, as I believe this part of the project speaks to those original goals.  The area along the planned route running west from Union Station has a vastly different commercial and residential composition from the corridor east of Union Station, and I do not believe it would benefit to the same degree. We should be examining trends and identifying geographic areas of need, then expanding existing service to better meet the needs of those areas."

      "question": "Last year, the DC Council approved $36 million in tax-increment financing to subsidize 600 additional parking spaces at Union Market. Are you supportive of the way that TIF proceeded or would you like to see changes for future TIFs, regarding parking and/or in general?",
      "response": "The Union Market district is a massive scale project (up to 8 million square feet at full build out) including close to 1 million square feet of retail, nearly double the amount of retail at Walter Reed and the Wharf combined and three times the retail at City Center DC. Building out this area will allow the city to help stem approximately $1 billion of retail sales leakage that the District experiences annually via retail sales outside of the District. In order to achieve this scale of development, the inadequate, aging public infrastructure (i.e. some utilities date back to the late 1800s) must be addressed. The tax-increment financing structure allows for an approach that minimizes disruption to existing and future businesses and provides the improvements the area needs for the viability of this area. The TIF amount of $82.4 million would have dedicated $46.4 million to fund upgrades to the infrastructure and $36 million to fund parking pools to establish a regional retail destination. Currently, there are very limited opportunities to locate the minimum needed retail parking to serve this large market area. The area has only a few parcels of adequate size that can float parking garages that would serve the patrons of the retail space that would be built out.  At full buildout, Union Market represents nearly $140 million of annual tax revenue, over 20,000 jobs and 500 units of affordable housing. As Chair of the Housing Committee, I always welcome more funding for affordable housing units. I am constantly attempting to find ways to improve programs and add affordable units to projects. However, the amendment that was proposed at the time of the vote added $18 million for a new Metro tunnel and $18 million for additional affordable housing, without addressing the clear need for parking infrastructure for the expansive retail area is to come. Furthermore, the Noma-Gallaudet metro stop currently has 2 existing exits, which at full build out of the retail area, would serve to meet the public transportation needs of the area. Upon realizing that the total government expenditure would exceed $80 million, it did cause me to pause and wonder whether we could have assisted Union Market at a lower level and still get a good return for the community. However, I believe that tax-increment financing is a vital tool in attracting private capital for development and necessary infrastructure upgrades. It is important that our TIFs are utilized in a strategic manner in line with the needs of the community where the financing would be utilized. In this particular case, by supporting existing public transportation and putting our funding to address the gap in inadequate parking infrastructure, the government will be more practical and efficient."

      "question": "Nearly 20 percent of all property in DC is protected by historic preservation law - more than Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia combined. Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "I firmly support the District's historic preservation process to preserve the architectural fabric of our communities, while at the same time, preserving the stability, vitality and social fabric of our existing lower-income neighborhoods. Although historic preservation is an appropriate means of urban revitalization by rehabilitating deteriorating homes, religious institutions, and office buildings, along with the benefits of urban renewal comes the seemingly inevitable spectre of gentrification and the destabilization and displacement of existing poorer communities.  Unfortunately, in the past historic preservation has too often only been the restoration of historically significant architectural sites for their aesthetic value. However, when historic buildings and neighborhoods are torn down, a part of our past disappears. When that happens, we not only forsake opportunities to enjoy beautiful old buildings, we also lose the history that helps to explain how we've arrived at where we are today.  At its essence, historic preservation is about telling the stories of our ancestors. This begs the question whose story is told? Given the social and economic inequalities of our society, few of the buildings associated with the history of minorities meet preservation standards regarding architectural significance. Although the histories of our minorities might not be encased in as magnificent a building, they do tell stories of faith, perseverance, and triumph that are relevant to any historic preservation effort. Buildings are important not only for their beauty, but also because of what took place inside a their walls over the years.  As the nation's capital, we need to do a better job of addressing local community and quality of life issues and find a better balance between economic development and the preservation of the heritage of local communities. There should be protections against wholesale gentrification included in our historic preservation process.  Historic preservation has potential to create local jobs, improve the quality of local life, and the local living environment.  Issues such as income distribution, job security, and social justice measurements such as life expectancy, literacy, or personal satisfaction with job and community should be included as measures of the success of our historic preservation efforts. It is therefore our job as legislators to ensure that there is a better balance in government priorities between preserving buildings to enhance the beauty of an area and to boost the economy, and preserving the livelihoods, well-being, and true local history and culture of every resident of our great city."

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "First of all, any time the District creates tax policy, it should seek the most progressive tax possible in every situation so that low-income and middle class families do not lose the access to and enjoyment of all that our city, their home, has to offer. When wealth is created, there are always a multitude of individuals, institutions, and amenities that contributed to that success. When raising money through taxes, we must have as one of our first principles the fair distribution of benefits of the city as a whole among the many people who help make it what it is.  Secondly, the District has a responsibility to provide services for the most vulnerable residents, whether they are homeless, in poverty, disabled, elderly, etc. For example, in passing Paid Family Leave, the Council created a social insurance program that is to be publicly administered; this is an advantage because, when seeking the benefit, employees will be able to engage with a government agency rather than their employer - who, by virtue of facing the competitive pressures of the market, may have incentive to avoid providing what is legally required. The interests of the government agency, on the other hand, will be in properly administering benefits in compliance with the law, so as to meet performance benchmarks and establish its ability to provide adequate service.     The District should emphasize this kind of thinking, recognizing that when we cede public control of a public resource or benefit before residents have accessed it, the market often takes control and produces unforeseeable consequences that disadvantage those with lower incomes. Two ways in which I will address this will be (1) to press the Housing Authority to ensure it maintains ownership and control over its assets as much as possible, and (2) to urge the Department of Housing and Community Development to creatively dispose of vacant and blighted properties in its inventory so as to directly benefit low-income and working class families.    When it comes to supporting the homeless, I advocate for the full funding the District's Homeward DC Plan, so that the District does not miss another deadline in its mission to make homeless rare, brief, and nonrecurring. It is crucial that we provide robust and direct intervervention for the homeless, and that we recognize that without access to housing these individuals are prevented from addressing the issues that originally caused their homelessness.  The Department of Human Services is continually modernizing and improving its systematic approach to addressing homelessness, and the Mayor and Council must step up and provide the means to expand that work. This means providing an ample budget for Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), which is the most complete and effective intervention for chronically homeless residents.     This will be a challenge, especially since this also puts pressure on the budget for the D.C. Housing Authority's Local Rent Supplement Program vouchers, which provide rental support for PSH households in addition to their original purpose of housing individuals on the Housing Authority's wait list. However, homelessness and housing instability are among the most dire circumstances a family could face, and they are systemic problems that only coordinated intervention can solve."

I am confident in our government's ability to maintain a balanced budget and to put money aside from our surplus in our reserve account. I have also been a strong proponent of utilizing any remainder of the budget surplus to fund additional affordable housing units via the various tools that the government currently employs including the Housing Production Trust Fund, the Preservation Fund, and our homeownership programs such as HPAP and EAHP."

      "question": "DC is amending its Comprehensive Plan. Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "I am running for DC Council Chair because I am concerned that economic growth is widening income and racial inequities in the District. I therefore want to make sure the Comp Plan update will support equitable development, in particular by placing a top priority on preserving and building affordable housing and preventing displacement. Unfortunately, the proposed Comp Plan does not provide appropriate emphasis on affordable housing, which is shocking and unacceptable.    The Comp Plan can support preservation and creation of affordable housing in several ways.  First, it should send a strong signal that affordable housing is the top priority for Planned Unit Developments, projects that typically group multiple parcels of land and seek some variation from zoning rules in return for providing enhanced community benefits. A key reason for approving a PUD is that it creates more affordable housing than otherwise would occur.  The “affordable” housing should focus as much as possible on homes affordable to residents with incomes below 60 percent of AMI, since nearly all households with severe affordable housing challenges have incomes this low.  Second, the Comp Plan should limit displacement of affordable housing in a given development project. Third, when projects preserve existing affordable housing, the Comp Plan should prioritize processes that help ensure that existing tenants are able to remain in their community through the development process and beyond, including “build first” policies and rules about “right of return” that do not discriminate against low-income residents. Finally, the Comp Plan generally should not allow developers to meet affordable housing requirements off-site, which would lead to concentration of affordable housing in DC's lowest-income communities.    The Comp Plan also should support increased development near transit, to help accommodate DC's growing population and housing demand.    I recognize that there is substantial community concern that proposed changes to the Comp Plan would limit community input on PUD's and in particular would limit review of Zoning Commission decisions.  As Chair, I would not move forward with Comp Plan changes until those issues are addressed, in a way that addresses community concerns and creates clear rules for development."

      "response": "Creating a well-connected network of dedicated bus and bike lanes is important to DC's future, accommodating a growing population, serving the wide range of residents who cannot afford a car or who choose not to do so, and reducing traffic congestion.    At the same time, expanding bus or bike lanes should be done in a way that minimizes  antagonism and problems for people who choose to drive or have little choice but to drive. This includes former DC residents connected to DC churches, many of whom left DC because of issues like affordable housing or schools. Whenever possible, the District should work with affected communities to ensure that dedicated bike or bus lanes do not greatly restrict access to on-street parking in that community.    Dedicated bus lanes should be completed for the 16th Street rush hour transit improvement project, as well as for H ST NW downtown, once DDOT has worked with affected stakeholders to reconcile potential conflicts.  The priorities for bike lanes should be expanding protected bike lanes whenever possible, rather than simply striping a bike lane, and completing the Metropolitan Branch Trail."

      "response": "The District should commit to identifying new revenues dedicated to Metro to meet its share of the $500 million annual regional need. Under the current formula, that is roughly $180 million.  It is worth exploring, at some point in the future, whether the District's share of Metro expenses is reasonable, but it should not happen now because that would complicate regional efforts to address Metro's needs.    I believe that the District should identify a range of new revenue sources that can be bondable to meet Metro's needs, with costs split between businesses and residents and with taxes/fees on residents set in a progressive way (where impact as share of income is greater for high-income families than low-income families.) Meeting such a large an important demand as Metro should call for raising revenues, rather than trying to draw from existing revenue sources in a way that would limit funding for schools, housing, and more.  The revenue increases should be shared between businesses and residents, because both benefit from a healthy public transit system.  And impacts of the new revenue sources on low- and moderate income families should be minimized, since many already struggle to keep up with the high and rising cost of living in DC.    I oppose using the sales tax as a primary source of funding DC's Metro obligation, because a sales tax falls disproportionately on low-income households and does not require businesses to pay their fair share of supporting Metro."

      "response": "My highest priorities for improving DC's transit are to fund improvements at Metrorail and to improve bus service, with tools such as dedicated bus and faster ways to board and pay fares. I support extension of the streetcar to Benning Road. I support extension of the streetcar to Georgetown, after achieving these other priorities. It is worth noting that the streetcar project has been flawed and poorly handled from the beginning, including recent information that the current fleet may need to be replaced and that the District has not yet developed plans for how t manage fare collections. It is a reminder that expansion of the streetcar should be planned carefully.     I'd like to use this as an opportunity to discuss my support in 2014, through the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, to implement Tax Commission recommendations by changing the funding for the streetcar project. At that time, the formula for funding the streetcar set aside a substantial portion of every additional dollar in revenue growth to streetcars, which we had criticized as a simplistic and unusual formula, one that seemed to set aside more funding than needed for streetcars and that put funding for other basic needs at risk. In supporting the proposal to implement the Tax Commission recommendations, DCFPI wrote that “the revenue loss would be offset by by altering the formula for devoting funds to the city's streetcar project, which currently sets aside more than needed. The new proposal would maintain adequate funding for streetcars while freeing up revenues that can be used for tax reductions.” It was our belief that this proposal right-sized funding for streetcars while supporting the tax initiatives."

      "response": "I opposed the 2017 decision to provide subsidies to developers in the Union Market area for several reasons. First, the subsidy will go to an area that is gentrifying and does not need public subsidies. An analysis by the DC CFO concluded that no subsidy is needed to support this development, a conclusion backed up by the common-sense observation that development already is occurring there. It is especially problematic that the District subsidy was for a parking lot, rather than for investments that would support other ways to get to Union Market other than by car.    Second, the District has not asked the developers for anything in return for the subsidy. In particular, there are no requirements beyond First Source to hire DC residents, and there are no requirements around wages and benefits for construction and permanent jobs there. This means that the development will likely be non-union jobs with low wages and limited benefits, matching the experience with The Wharf development that opened in 2017. The Union Market TIF also had no requirements for additional affordable housing.      Third, the use of public subsidies for an area that does not need help and for a parking lot is a misplaced focus and lost opportunity to promote transit-oriented development and to support other communities that need help, such as bringing better grocery options to residents living east of the Anacostia River who want affordable and healthy food choices.     As Council Chair, I would fight to ensure that economic development go to projects that are determined to need public subsidy, that will focus on under-served communities, and that will meet important public purposes like transit."

Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "Preserving unique historic structures in DC is an important part of protecting DC's heritage, particularly as major redevelopment occurs throughout the city.  At the same time redevelopment is an important part of progress and adapting to growth and change. Restricting the housing stock for any reason, including historic preservation, places upward pressure on prices and contributes to the spread of gentrification. In addition, historic preservation raises the costs of maintaining and renovating individual properties.    An overly broad historic preservation process can restrict the kind of redevelopment that can help cities make important and needed progress. The fact that DC has designated a very large share of its property as historic, even compared with cities of similar age and historic significance, suggests that a review of our historic designation process makes sense.    I support having the District conduct a comprehensive survey of its properties as a way of identifying individual properties that are unique and of historic significance, as well as identifying types of structures that are historically unique, for which preserving a notable share would be the goal. In the absence of such a registry, it is difficult to determine whether a given property is an important contribution to historic preservation, rather than one of many properties of that type; the lack of a registry thus can contribute to over-designation of the number of properties as worthy of protection."

We can close this gap through a number of steps related to jobs and job quality  Eliminating the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, which leaves many servers in poverty, and leaves many women to tolerate abuse to protect tips  Adopt fair scheduling requirements for restaurants and retail stores to help part-time workers plan their lives - like going to school or taking a second job - and help part-time workers get closer to a full-time schedule.   Implement DC's paid family and medical leave law  Engage in more strategic and rigorous enforcement of DC's labor laws  Push for more transparency and accountability in DC's job training programs, as part of efforts to improve the quality and coordination of these programs.     Beyond these, I am fully committed to funding the Homeward DC plan to make homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring.  We need to stop making excuse for the mayor and Council not funding this plan.  In addition, I am committed to doubling DC's investments in key affordable housing programs, to help ensure that residents can avoid falling into homelessness. "

      "question": "How would you support using the District's current budget surplus? If in the future the District falls into recession creating budget gaps in the $200-400 million range, what would you propose doing then?",
      "response": "The District has been stockpiling surpluses for almost a decade, adding $1.5 billion since 2010.  That reflects a policy adopted then to place 100% of surpluses into reserves until those reserves reach specified levels -- which still have not been met.  I have long advocated for a more balanced approach that puts some surplus funds in savings and invests some in important capital projects, like building affordable housing and schools. As Council chair, I would invest most or all of future surpluses in these kinds of benefits that support DC residents and our long-term economic potential. That also would leave DC with a more than adequate rainy day fund to manage a recession."

      "response": "●\\tI support a dedicated funding stream for Metro.  ●\\tIn general, I don't believe the current governance structure is functional. It may have been originally designed to maximize stakeholder participation by the funding jurisdictions, but in practice it has led to paralysis and regional factionalism. I would like to see a smaller and more empowered board.   ●\\tI am a strong supporter of organized labor, and I would not back a dedicated funding stream unless the increase in dollars for capital expenditures carried provisions limiting cuts to employee pensions and benefits. Metro is a public good, not a private company, and we need to make it whole by funding it properly, not by mimicking corporate profit maximization tactics and taking all the cost savings on the back of workers. The human error element of Metro's Safety track record will not be improved by making employment at WMATA less attractive.  ●\\tHow to pay for it? I am a supporter of the proposal advanced by Delegate Korman and Senator Feldman in the 2018 session of the General Assembly (HB0372, SB0227) to establish a dedicated fund account in the Transportation Trust Fund, and mandating a prior year base plus 3% floor in the capital budget. The current proposal would direct $125 million/year from the  Motor Vehicle Excise Tax into the new Metro fund in the TTF for grants to WMATA capital needs, and would also raise the total dollars in the capital budget to around $175 million by 2023 - as opposed to ~$155 million projected today. The fiscal note for the bills projects a huge hit to the overall capital funds ($1.2 billion for the five years starting in FY19) for MDOT as a result of this, based on the fact that the $125 million diverted to Metro would reduce the pledgeable tax revenue that the department can use to secure bond issues. However I disagree with some of the analysis. For one thing, there seems to be an implicit assumption in their numbers that interest rates will rise and the bond market will tighten. More importantly, the analysis uses MDOT's conservative management practice for how it calculates its coverage ratio. The statutory requirement is that revenue and pledged taxes for a given FY must equal 2.0 times the total debt service on all outstanding future obligations that year. But in practice, MDOT requires pledgeable income to be 2.5 times outstanding obligations. It's not that I object to prudent fiscal management, but I think the reality is for a priority as important as funding Metro, we could easily instruct a reduction in practice to at least a 2.2 to 1  ratio without jeopardizing our AAA bond rating, and that alone would significantly soften the projected shortfall to borrowing capacity. What I'm saying is the fiscal note writers are erring on the side of caution and it's creating too much doom and gloom around this very reasonable proposal."

      "response": "●\\tI do not support the proposed expansion of I-495; in its current form, the plan is unrealistic - the number of houses abutting the Beltway that would have to be acquired and then destroyed alone makes the governor's assumptions about the costs unrealistic. As I am running to represent District 18, where a good percentage of those houses are, there is no simply no way I could back this proposal. I also believe it would end up being so astronomically expensive it could detract from the state's ability to support other, critical transit infrastructure projects.  ●\\tI am more open to the idea of widening I-270 in general, though Gov. Hogan's existing plan is not one that I support. We have already seen with the previous I-270 widening that more car lanes will be met with an influx of new cars. Instead, I would support a modest (one or two lanes on each side beginning in the heaviest use area and continuing from there) expansion of this key MD artery that is reserved for public transportation such as BRT.  ●\\tGiven the reality of limited public financing, I would prioritize expansion of BRT, MARC, and the corridor cities transitway over lane expansion projects. It aligns with my belief that we will never successfully tackle our transit crisis by incentivizing more vehicles on the roads rather than investing in really world class public transportation."

Some demographic change to areas targeted for significant new development around transit hubs is inevitable - but it is important to preserve access to that transit - including the ability to live nearby - for the many moderate income residents who would be able to benefit from it.

      "response": "●\\tMy overall view is that this kind of incentive competition between jurisdictions where so many residents cross frequently back and forth to access jobs, entertainment, and services just leads to waste of taxpayer dollars and/or loss of much needed revenue. That perspective strongly informs my views on all of these questions.  ●\\tI do not support the use of public funds or incentives, in any shape or form, for the potential new NFL stadium. I support the creation of a legal compact between Maryland, D.C., and Virginia, to avoid this, as proposed in Delegate David Moon's legislation last session and this current session. We have seen over and over again around the country and the world (look at the ROI on various Olympics public works programs for example) that stadium construction just does not bring the economic miracles that are promised. So providing a tax break or bonded support to one of the wealthiest sports franchises in the world offends me. It's not the role government is supposed to play in development.      ●\\tI believe it is incumbent upon Maryland, DC, and Virginia to work together to fund and improve the regional WMATA Metro system, as described in my answer to the first question on the questionnaire.   ●\\tAs for the Amazon's HQ2 bidding process, the prospect of the completely game-changing number of high-paying jobs that would be created gives me pause in my usual objection to the incentive competition. I do believe that the net benefit to the whole region makes it worth trying to do some things to sweeten the pot for Amazon. However, I strongly believe that the HQ2 locating in any of the three jurisdictions would have positive impact on all of them, and were I a Delegate today, I would have pushed strongly as I could for a similar regional compact on the issue. If the HQ2 locates in Montgomery County, clearly many thousands of new jobs might be created for people who choose to live in Northern Virginia or the district - and yet only Maryland taxpayers will be footing the bill for the incentive."

We also need to continue to push Congress to make more investments and restore their appropriate funding.     I do not believe there is one specific source of funding, whether it's from a tax, toll, the general fund, or the transportation trust fund it's just critical that it is consistent and ongoing. I do however, firmly believe that the money must come from a source that is not just Montgomery or Prince Georges County. Five percent or almost 40,000 daily riders on Metro come from points in Maryland beyond those two counties. The whole state benefits from a strong transit system in the DC region and it should be a shared commitment to maintain that system.

I think we should reconfigure the board to create more accountability through the regional secretaries of transportation while also doing away with the jurisdictional veto. I support many of the recommendations in the proposal from the MD Metro Working Group which also call for increased transparency, particularly around budgeting and capital improvements, more community involvement, and a strengthened Inspector General."

      "question": "Do you support Governor Hogan's proposed expansion of I-495, I-270, and/or the BW Parkway? Why or why not? With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "I do not support Governor Hogan's proposals to expand those three roads. His ideas are a penny short and a pound foolish. It was outrageous that none of his proposals included any mention of mass transit, but relied on the incorrect and outdated idea that if all you do is build more roads, you can alleviate congestion. With our limited resources, we should be investing and prioritizing all the projects you mentioned in the question. Ironically, with the money Governor Hogan said his road expansion would cost, we could more than fully fund expansions for those projects. I would also like to explore the benefit of a commuter tax credit to promote the use of transit or some sort of additional subsidy to reduce the cost of transit for low income Marylanders. I think we should also be looking at ways to work with employers to promote creative solutions to the “last mile” problem, that gets people to and from their office and the transit hub. "

      "question": "Do you think the State Highway Administration appropriately balances walking, bicycling, car, and transit needs or does it favor fast car movement to the exclusion of other needs? Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "No, I do not think that the MD State High Administration appropriately balances these goals. I hear from voters all over the district – whether in Wheaton, East Bethesda, or Silver Spring that their communities are not walkable because of large state controlled roads. These roads are often dedicated solely to moving cars and only cars. We need more community engagement and a new approach from SHA to prioritize alternative modes of transportation. If we can encourage more people to walk, bike, or take transit, that will also reduce the volume of cars which will reduce traffic for those of us who do have to drive. While changes in some communities might require significant investments and infrastructure upgrades, others could be as simple as increasing the time available for pedestrians at a cross walk or adding better signage, lights, and visibility.

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Yes, the state should be doing all of the above mentioned in your question. While most zoning and planning authority rests with individual county governments, at the state level, we could be doing more to create and promote affordable housing. Particularly in areas that are being developed or benefiting from large scale state investments and subsidies – like the Purple Line – we should be requiring certain thresholds of affordable housing as a condition of receiving funding. We could also help speed state approval of certain permits or applications for any projects that meet certain criteria around development, density, and affordability. For existing business, I fully support Senator Will Smith's legislation to create a fund to support those adversely affected by large scale construction projects and I would love to explore creating some sort of assistance program that allows existing residents to purchase newly constructed homes in redeveloped areas they currently live in."

How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Yes – I would love to see more regional cooperation and collaboration. I'm pleased that on Metro, that seems to be more of a reality – particularly with the funding. It looks like all the regional and state governments finally understand that we all have to invest appropriately to ensure that we have a high-quality transit system. As for Amazon's HQ2, that is a perfect example of development that regardless of the location, will have an impact on all the surrounding jurisdictions. Employees from Amazon will live in all three localities and so we're going to – as a region – have to think about roads and transit, housing, and school crowding if Amazon picks a sight in our area. We should be talking more and planning together. On a new NFL stadium for our local team, I would fully support Delegate Moon's push for an interstate compact that would prevent public funds from being used for a private stadium.

I'm not a traffic expert, but I would assume speed would be the most important factor and I would be in favor of reducing speed when warranted. I'm also interested in looking at reconfiguring sidewalks and crosswalks to provide more pedestrian islands, as well more advanced signaling for pedestrian. We just had a pedestrian safety study done in Germantown that recommends taking away a lane of traffic to reduce the number of lanes in a particularly bad intersection (Middlebrook & Rt. 118). This was also done in the City of Gaithersburg in the Kentlands, where the main thoroughfare was redesigned to remove turn lanes to reduce the number of traffic lanes in the pedestrian crosswalk."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "Given that many of these projects have different funding mechanisms, prioritizing the list may not be useful. For instance, increasing capacity on I-270 does not compete with county-wide BRT. Similarly with MARC expansion - neither the County or the State has control over any major expansion. What we need there is more access to CSX tracks for an major improvement to take place. It's also difficult to compare state road projects vs. state transit projects because of the potential of private investment.     Both of these projects are equally important and can move forward on their own     Increased capacity on I-270 - this can be done with P3 funding, reversible lanes, express bus.    BRT - Rt 29 / 355    I also consider these projects to be important, but there is no political will to provide funding:    CCT - The Governor has basically said this project will not be funded in the near future. I established the CCT Coalition over ten years ago and have been actively pursuing this funding. I don't see it happening until we elect a new Governor.     Midcounty Hwy - I do not believe that the BRT on 355 is a substitute for this project.     As for MARC - it boggles my mind that Montgomery County and the State of Maryland cannot work something out with CSX to get increased service. I know there has been some discussion about mid-day service which is a start."

      "response": "I would support streamlining approval for all types of housing. Our approval process is lengthy and uncertain which adds to the cost of all housing.

      "question": "Do you think the current accessory dwelling process is working well? Do you support the County Board's recent changes? Would you expand it to allow converting existing garages or other structures? What other changes would you make?",
      "response": "Simply put, an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a second dwelling unit with a kitchen, bathroom and separate entrance on a single-family lot. The Affordable Housing Master Plan appropriately recognizes ADUs as another tool to expand affordable housing opportunities without public subsidies and facilitate additional homeowner income and aging in place. While the County has had an ADU ordinance since 2009, only 20 have been built, and I backed the process to reconsider the various restrictions on ADU's that have inhibited their creation.     Action taken by the County Board in November 2017 greatly expands the potential for the creation of new ADU's, but I view the Board's action as a mixed bag. While I fully supported the proposal to remove size limits on ADU's contained wholly within the basement of an existing home, and am pleased with provisions to require owner occupancy of either the main dwelling or the ADU, I am uncomfortable with the Board's vote to allow conversion of existing (as of our November 2017 adoption date) outside accessory buildings to accessory dwelling use for structures like garages that may literally be just one foot from a neighbor's property line. Having a garage, a shed, or other uninhabited structure one foot from someone's property line is one thing--facilitating the creation of a habitable dwelling for up to three unrelated people with the attendant potential for noise, light and movement, and the loss of privacy, at all hours of the day and night, is another proposition entirely--and one that I believe needed more analysis and community engagement.      I was pleased that the Board did defer legalization of newly erected (after November 2017) detached ADU's in order to examine such issues as appropriate setback requirements, but it is also imperative that we examine the environmental implications and potential loss of tree canopy that would surely come with new freestanding backyard structures of up to 750 square feet with attendant foundations and other structural and operational necessities like plumbing and other utilities.    Finally, I was disappointed that the Board decided not to adopt a key recommendation of our Planning Commission--to limit the creation of new ADU's to 200 per year. This cap seemed reasonable to me as a way of reassuring the community that single family neighborhoods would not be suddenly overrun with new housing units and the accompanying implications for parking, traffic, schools and community infrastructure. In addition, under the revised ordinance, a homeowner could convert an ADU into accessory homestay use  (i.e., AirBnB), with a simple County permit, thus doing nothing to actually boost the supply of modestly priced housing that is intended by the new legislation. The Board should have started with the 200 annual limit proposed by the Planning Commission, a limit that could always be adjusted. Why not take the time to assess the full consequences of ADU's and manage their growth in a deliberate manner?"

      "question": "Arlington adopted an affordable housing master plan in 2015 which sets a goal of 600 new units per year and 17% of housing affordable to people making 60% of AMI or less. What would you do to ensure it reaches those goals?",
      "response": "I was pleased to join my Board colleagues three years ago in unanimous adoption of the ambitious AHMP. Since that time, I have supported a number of concrete steps to implement the document. Just in calendar year 2017, the Board unanimously voted to add 598 units of new housing for low-and-moderate income households through $30 million in Affordable Housing Investment Fund (AHIF) loans, which loans are funded both by County monies and developer contributions.      Working with our non-profit affordable housing developers, the Board approved substantial rehabilitation of the Berkeley on South Glebe Road, new construction of a mixed-use project at the Central United Methodist Church site in Ballston, and an acquisition loan for the Park Shirlington Apartments.     In February 2018, we unanimously approved funding for a new 12-story affordable project in the heart of Rosslyn—Queens Court.    At my urging, the AHMP strengthened requirements for greater geographic distribution of affordable housing projects throughout the County, and I was especially pleased to advocate for the rescue of 68 units in the Westover community off Washington Boulevard, just a few blocks from my house.    At the same time, it is important to recognize that AHIF funding is finite, and we need to be more creative and resourceful in working towards greater housing affordability. To this end, last year I supported the Board's adoption of reduced parking guidelines for new residential developments in the Metro corridors. I also believe that the County must consider a number of potential strategies for reducing costs and expanding resources to meet the production goals of the AHMP as described in “Fulfilling the Promise”, a December 2017 document presented to the County Board by an array of for-profit and nonprofit developers and affordable housing groups.      With my support, County staff is now examining the feasibility of a number of recommendations in the report, including (a) reducing site plan conditions for new affordable housing construction, (b) waiving or reducing certain permit and tap fees for such projects, (c) overhauling use permit conditions for rehabilitation projects, (d) modernizing the development process for smaller sites, and (e) offering property tax abatements or exemptions.    Potential revenue ideas that may have merit include increased dedicated recordation tax and special purpose general obligation bonds.    Finally, we can't lose sight of the fact that the AHMP is not just about housing production. Important Master Plan goals we need to make a reality include (a) ensuring equal housing access through enforcement of Arlington's Human Rights ordinance, the Fair Housing Act and other laws, as well as through housing vouchers, home ownership assistance, displacement assistance, and homeless prevention, (b), enabling Arlingtonians to age in place through real estate tax relief and other programs and services geared to seniors, and (c) ensuring that our housing efforts contribute toward fiscal and environmental sustainability through rigorous property code enforcement, physical inspections, financial monitoring and audits, and environmental standards."

Would you support transportation changes that improve bus and/or bicycle access even if it might slow down single-passenger car traffic?",
      "response": "As someone who lives in the Tara-Leeway Heights community, I appreciate Lee Highway—just blocks away—both for its diverse array of neighborhood retail and services as well as its value as a multi-modal commuter thoroughfare. I often take the ART 55 or the Metrobus 3Y to or from the East Falls Church Metro Station and points in between, or, in the case of the 3Y, to and from the District.    While the County Manager has proposed a slowdown in comprehensive planning for Lee Highway in order to fulfill County Board direction to avoid another property tax rate increase this year, I am committed to seeing the Lee Highway planning process continue as expeditiously as possible. A future Lee Highway can further contribute to the economic competitiveness and tax base of Arlington County through realization of its promise as a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly and inclusive community where people of all incomes can live, work and be at leisure.    We expect to provide continued funding to the non-profit Lee Highway Alliance again this year, a true, grassroots-neighborhood and business-oriented nonprofit that facilitates the great variety of voices and stakeholders flanking the corridor. A Request for Proposals (RFP) has been recently let for a consultant to assist with the next stage of the planning process, including the scope of work, major milestones and work products, and a roadmap for civic engagement. The County will convene the official project kick-off with community stakeholders once the full team is in place before 2018 is out.    I believe that it makes good planning sense to introduce additional, but sensitively-placed, mixed use density along Lee Highway, particularly near the main commercial nodes. Any such added density should taper down adjacent to the neighborhoods—a central tenet of Arlington's planning principles. Yet the plethora of commercial property owners and the relative shallowness of many sites eligible for commercial redevelopment will make this a challenge. We should consider a streamlined, less costly site plan process to incentivize such redevelopment.  But no one wants to see the Clarendonization of Lee Highway or the wholesale loss of its many one-of-a-kind restaurants and businesses, many of which are owned or operated by our newest Americans.    Finally, we need to recognize that Lee Highway is controlled by the state and is a major evacuation route.   While more intensified bus service may be needed as population and density increase over time, I do not now see traffic lane reconfiguration or bicycle lanes as safe and viable options. As I observe in response to the Columbia Pike question below, any multimodal improvements must be calibrated to avoid the unfortunate byproduct of encouraging traffic diversion onto nearby neighborhood streets."

      "response": "Columbia Pike ranks as one of the most heavily traveled roads in both the state and region. With both greater residential and commercial development and density now taking hold along most of Columbia Pike, the County Board must continue its commitment to premium bus transit and multimodal improvements along the Pike.    While coordination with Metro and the state can be a slow and cumbersome process and funding is not unlimited, I am working with my colleagues and staff to:    A—Ensure implementation of Arlington's new Transit Development Plan (TDP), adopted unanimously by the County Board in July 2016. The TDP calls for development of premium transit service along the entire Pike corridor in Arlington, ensuring continuous “through” service from the Fairfax County line through Pentagon City and Crystal City, south to Potomac Yard. Premium transit amenities include upgraded transit stations with real-time passenger information, off-vehicle fare collection, transit signal priority and branded vehicles and information. The network will include “layered” limited stop service, local connector service and better neighborhood connections via enhanced service on the ART 41, 45 and 74.    B—Continue the realization of the Pike Multimodal Street Improvements and related Complete Streets projects to add bike routes, street trees, landscaped median areas and improved pedestrian crossings to enhance both access and safety for transit riders, vehicle users, cyclists and pedestrians.    At the same time, we must work to ensure that Pike multimodal travel enhancements do not have the unintended consequence of increased cut-through traffic on adjacent neighborhood streets."

      "question": "What areas of the budget should be targeted for reduction and which should be protected from cuts, given the county board's no tax increase direction?",
      "response": "As the County Board directed last fall, the County Manager released his proposed FY 2019 budget on February 22, 2018, which provided a balanced budget at the existing property tax rate of $0.993.    After having raised the property tax rate by 1.5 cents last year (which increase was allocated roughly half to schools and half to our ailing Metro system), the Board reaffirmed our level rate at its February 24 Board meeting by setting the advertised tax rate for calendar year 2018 at the current rate. (Arlington's fiscal year and tax assessment year do not exactly coincide.)    Accordingly, the Manager's proposal sets up some difficult choices to bridge a $20.5 million revenue-expenditures gap, induced by declining office property values (down 7.3 %), even though residential values increased 3.8%.    To arrive at his proposed budget, the Manager proposed about $8.4 million in spending reductions (both in programs and personnel), $6.6 million in targeted tax and fee increases, and $5.5 million in strategic funding realignments.    Despite the reductions proposed across virtually every County Department, I am pleased to note that the Manager's budget seeks to maintain several longstanding County Board priorities, including;    —Metro, by meeting the agency's request for a 3% increase in operational funding.  (As a daily transit user, I believe it is vital to our economic and environmental sustainability that our regional transit circulatory system be maintained and ultimately enhanced, through a combination of strengthened oversight and governance reforms and a permanent, dedicated funding stream.)    —Our growing, highly-rated Public Schools, through providing $13.4 million in additional ongoing funding and adherence to our Revenue-Sharing Principles, for a total transfer to APS of almost $500 million.    —Affordable Housing, by funding the Affordable Housing Investment Fund (AHIF) at current levels and fully funding Housing Grants, which go directly to eligible tenants.    It is now up to the Board to ultimately decide the exact mix and nature of cuts, tax and fee hikes and funding reallocations necessary to maintain our current property tax rate.   From now through April 21 with our final budget adoption, we will gather input from County staff through a series of public briefings, engage with our many County advisory boards and commissions, stakeholders and the public (including Greater Greater Washington), and hold two public hearings on April 3 and 5.

      "response": "As I write this, there is state legislation gathering momentum in Richmond (SB 856) that would make numerous changes to the administration of and revenues for public transit in the Commonwealth, including funding for Metro.  Yet the details of the legislation are intricate and the ramifications almost impossible to assess at this point.  While, as a daily Metro rider, I believe it is critical that Metro be provided with a permanent, dedicated funding source, and though it is true that the revenue sources can be perfected over time, I am disappointed that the funding structure appears to relieve the Commonwealth of responsibility for contributing more for Metro--a system that contributes to the economic prosperity of the entire state.    We don't yet know exactly how much \"local share\" money for Arlington might be diverted from Arlington towards Metro, and away from a wide range of uses for local transportation and transit projects.   These important projects range from new transit infrastructure serving our ART system, to multimodal improvements in our corridors like Columbia Pike and Lee Highway, to \"complete streets\" projects such as the Lynn Street Esplanade and Custis Trail improvements, Clarendon Circle improvements, upgraded traffic signals and strategic analysis and planning.    It will take some time to learn the exact consequences of any reductions, but I will be listening as we engage the public and our citizens' advisory commissions to help set priorities, whether that involves project cancellations, deferrals, time extensions, or modifications."

      "question": "DC is amending its Comprehensive Plan. Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "Yes, I support policies in the new Comp Plan to add housing and to create and preserve much more affordable housing.  Moreover, I'll write them into the legislation.  The creation of housing is a priority, necessary to meet the population growth estimated to occur, and must be added in all parts of the city.  The creation of affordable housing is equally important; studies repeatedly show that tens of thousands of units are necessary if we are to overcome gentrification and maintain economic diversity.  What has not been emphasized enough is the need to preserve affordable housing.  Also underemphasized is the need for workforce housing (e.g., teachers, firefighters, and police).  In addition to the Land Use Element and the land use maps, the Housing Element should address these issues in detail.  The Housing Element can also reinforce strategies to strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing.  Strategies such as rent control and housing first."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "Yes, I support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes.  And I would support them in some locations even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases.  Importantly, though, the decision on where to locate these facilities is not up to the Council.  Also, importantly, I have voted for these facilities when proposed by DDOT before the National Capital Transportation Board.  I add one caveat regarding dedicated bus lanes: there has to be an increase in bus service.  Ninth Street, NW is an example of where a bus lane has been a failure.  Sixteenth Street is an example of where a dedicated bus lane makes sense – with an increase in service.  Perhaps K Street, too, in lieu of streetcar service."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including $178 million from DC? How would you achieve this? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "I absolutely support dedicated, bondable funding for WMATA and have argued with regional colleagues against “other steps” as a precondition.  I believe the District's stance, with which I have been a leader, is a reason why the so-called “other steps” have had no traction in either Richmond or Annapolis this year.    I have also been a leader among regional officials as identifying $500 million as the funding level that should be dedicated.  However, Richmond is anti-tax and anti-Northern Virginia, and Maryland's Republican governor has insisted on only $125 million in non-bondable funding. Further, as you know, expert panels (a Blue Ribbon Commission in 2006 and a COG technical panel) have recommended a regional uniform sales tax as the best and most equitable approach.  Under this, the District's share would be $125 million annually (because we have the smallest tax base of the three states).  Nonetheless, I expect that the District will adopt a higher amount (with my support), and that the three states will agree to split their contributions equally.  This will be dedicated, bondable funding that is new (on top of existing subsidies).  Unfortunately, the sources of funding will differ by jurisdiction, which may affect the bondability, but I believe the District will dedicate a portion of its sales tax, which means we will have the highest credit worthiness of the three states."

      "response": "I support funding the DC Streetcar to extend east to Benning Road Metro in Ward 7, and I ensured this was funded last year when we adopted the CIP.  We may improve the timing of the funding this year.  I do not support extending the streetcar west to Georgetown.  It is too expensive, too unpopular, and has yet to demonstrate that it is the most efficient way to move commuters cross town.  With regard to infrastructure, I assume this means transportation, and busses are the easiest, quickest, and most expandable means of improving access; we can add busses easily and quickly.  I think much more investment – coupled with advertising to attract/increase ridership – should be given to bus service."

      "question": "Last year, the DC Council approved $36 million in tax-increment financing to subsidize 600 additional parking spaces at Union Market. Are you supportive of the way that TIF proceeded or would you like to see changes for future TIFs, regarding parking and/or in general?",
      "response": "Yes, I am supportive of the way that TIF proceeded.  The value of TIFs is that they stimulate development – and the subsidy is actually the revenue increment generated by the development. While development at Union Market likely would occur without a TIF, it would not be as quick.  What we can expect, because of the TIF, is more of the exciting retail that has been created in recent years.  That includes an interesting mix of small and DC-based businesses.  It is unlikely, in my view, that such a mix would be seen, without the TIF, in what's still left to be developed.  The question errs in stating that the TIF subsidizes 600 “additional parking spaces.”  I do not have the exact numbers, but all of the current, surface parking lots are going to be lost, and the TIF subsidizes parking to replace that, as well as add some."

Historic preservation has been shown over and over to promote stability in neighborhoods.  These include low-income neighborhoods such as the Anacostia Historic District."

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "Clearly, education is the best and most obvious strategy to reduce income inequality.  The growing gap between rich and poor, whites and blacks, is a national problem and is affected by federal government actions.  The effect in the District is that the median household income for whites is $127,369 and for blacks it is $37,891.  We also know that the median salary for someone with a bachelor's degree is $65,886, but only $30,311 for someone with a high school diploma.  Further, only 25.6% of blacks have a college degree, while 92% of whites in the District have a college degree.  I have continually supported additional funding for our primary and secondary schools, as well as our public university.  Indeed, in recent budgets I am the one who has supported and increased funding additions by the Council.  I have protected the Community College when some threatened it.  I have been a leader in pushing for improved attendance in our schools.  As for homelessness, I have looked for the balance between what advocates have called for in additional funding, and what DHS has had the capacity to actually spend.  There is no point in, say, doubling funding for vouchers if there isn't the capacity in available units or to process the vouchers.  If you look at recent annual budgets, you will see that the Council has increased funding for homelessness services each year above the Mayor's request, and often those increases have been at my initiative.  You will also see that each year the DHS returns monies unspent at year-end.  The solution here, as with many of our challenges, is not simply to throw more money at the problem.  While funding needs to be adequate, how it is spent is critical.  For example, the Mayor proposed ward-based shelters to replace DC General, but it was controversial because of questionable leases.  I steered the Council to support ward-based shelters costing almost $90 million less (requiring city-owned sites) – still helping homelessness but more carefully using our resources."

      "response": "If the District falls into recession creating budget gaps, I would look at cuts and, absolutely, look to tap our “rainy day” cash reserves.  The reserves are meant to help smooth the need to cut.      As for the current “budget surplus,” there is none.  So beware of candidates promising to spend it.  Last year's so-called “surplus” was actually spent before it occurred.  Some was allocated to future fiscal year spending (such as labor contracts) and the rest automatically went to increase required debt service reserves and the federally required cash reserve.    We have a fund balance of about $2.7 million.  Of this, about $1.2 million is in the cash reserves.  Of the remaining $1.5 million, about $505 million is already appropriated for the FY 2019-2022 budgets.  Another $570 million is required to be set aside as debt service reserves.  The remainder is tied up in special purpose funds, such as the bag tax to fund a cleaner Anacostia River, the Renewable Energy Development Fund, and funding for the Peoples' Counsel and Public Service Commission."

      "question": "Due to their length and midday time, many residents other than retirees and people being paid to attend can't realistically participate in most DC Council hearings. Budgets which come from the chairman with substantial changes the night before the vote don't allow for much public participation. How would you improve council processes and/or technology to improve public participation?",
      "response": "I continue to look for suggestions to improve public access and participation in the Council's processes.  Having said that, here's what I've done.  First, because of Budget Autonomy (which I authored and pushed, including suing for a court judgment), the Council now votes twice on the budget, which means the public has two weeks to comment between first and second readings – two weeks it never had before.  Second, we publish our budget hearing and mark-up schedule months in advance.  In addition, the Council is better (but not yet perfect), in publishing all budget-related documents on-line.  In all of these ways, we have improved public access and therefore opportunity for public participation.  I looked back some 10-15 years to see when predecessors circulated their proposed budgets and I've been consistently earlier.  Your question evokes memories of 2010 when Vince Gray surprised everyone by eviscerating the street car budget at 6:00 a.m.  Not only have I not done anything so drastic, but my proposals have been consistently earlier than Brown, Gray, or Cropp.  Still, I'm open to suggestions.    A concluding comment:  While the questions I have answered are important, they barely touch on the most important issue in electing the Chairman of the Council.  This election is not just about being a member of the Council, it's about being the leader of the legislative branch.  If you look at my record, time and again I have demonstrated the ability to maneuver controversial legislation through the Council, possible Mayoral veto, and possible Congressional interference.  Marriage equality, Tax Revision Commission reform, Universal Paid Leave, Ward-based homeless shelters to replace DC General, etc.  I have demonstrated the ability to build consensus and get the votes.  Moreover, I have demonstrated the ability to work with the Mayor, and at other times stand up to the Mayor.  Collaboration, as well as checks and balances, are essential to successful government.      These are requisite qualities, and I will bring them to bear as I continue to tighten oversight over the dysfunctional Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and press for better public education.  In many ways our city is better today than it was a few years ago, but there remain pressing challenges, and I am the best person to lead the legislative branch to a better future."

Physical changes to pedestrian crossings, lane width, vehicle speed, and other engineering-related aspects of the plan would have an enormous impact on the frequency with which pedestrians are placed in danger on our roadways.

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "While it is important that the County provide sufficient funds to maintain the quality of our current road network, I strongly support funding mass transit and pedestrian projects over new highway expansion projects. At the County level, I will prioritize the BRT network, which is an affordable option for providing improved mobility for residents relative to some of the proposed road projects. The current Council has already ensured that M-83 will not be a funding priority anytime soon, if ever; I strongly support that stance. I also support the current Council's likely action to move funds from the Montrose Parkway East to other projects, including the potential East pedestrian entrance to the Forest Glen Metro station.

I would also adjust the MPDU qualifications so that lower income individuals and families would be able to access some of the MPDUs that are currently out of their reach. We can also expand the housing stock by making it as easy as possible for homeowners to add accessory apartments, which has the added benefit of generating income for aging residents who want to continue living in single family homes, even as their income declines in retirement."

      "question": "Which proposal do you support for the redevelopment of the old Silver Spring Library? What do you believe is the best use of the site, and how does that reflect your general approach to new development and redevelopment projects?",
      "response": "I am extremely disappointed with the proposal that has been selected by County Executive Leggett for the former Silver Spring Library site. The happiest residents of Montgomery County that I've encountered during the ten months I've been campaigning are the residents of The Bonifant, a senior housing building owned by MHP in downtown Silver Spring. The Victory Housing proposal would have provided many similar amenities for its residents to those enjoyed at The Bonidant: reduced rent, walkability, and proximity to shopping and mass transit.    The Victory Housing proposal came closer to reflecting my general approach to redevelopment projects because it would have provided much needed low income housing, although I would have liked to see more green space on the site - like a small natural grass soccer field, for example - due to the extreme lack of open green space in downtown Silver Spring. I would have also have liked to see less surface parking and infant care in the proposed child care facility. I'm a strong proponent of affordable housing, but I also believe in the importance of a livable physical environment with plenty of public amenities for people to enjoy, which means that not every square single foot of close-in areas can be built to maximum density. The overreliance on pocket parks, for example, has created a lack of real public green space in Silver Spring, an unfortunately feature of that community that many visitors notice they walk around downtown.

      "response": "    Clearly lower income residents who work multiple jobs just to get by are under-represented in County government in general. If working class people really had power in the County, I imagine they would demand much more than additional subsidized rental housing; they would likely demand investment in a system that would help them build real financial assets for their families, like a community land trust or a massive program to support first time homebuyers. I've recently met with representatives from multiple Common Ownership Communities, and they are intensely frustrated with the way condo associations are treated differently under County regulatory rules and fee schedules versus single family homes. Folks who live in rental units and condo buildings are drastically under-represented in County government because it's easier for wealthier residents to have the time and energy to advocate for themselves at County hearings. I'd like to change that dynamic by making sure that renters and condo owners have a seat at the table when the County makes big housing decisions - they shouldn't have to wait until a public hearing in which everyone gets three minutes to speak in order to make their voices heard. Expanding public support for tenant groups and COC organizations would also help to amplify their advocacy efforts on County issues.  "

      "response": "I absolutely support Maryland contributing at least $167 million to ensure dedicated, bondable funding for Metro. As a daily Metro rider, I experience the constant barrage of service problems firsthand. Providing a dedicated source of revenue is necessary, though not sufficient, to fix these issues and stabilize the system. We have no other option: A reliable transit system is required to boost economic growth, combat climate change, improve quality of life, and empower working families.     The bulk of the funding should come from recipients of Metro's property value appreciation: the real estate industry. I support tax-assessment districts, which would recoup a portion of the boosted property values enjoyed by property owners in close proximity to rail and bus stations. I oppose increasing the sales tax to fund Metro because it would disproportionately harm working people already struggling to make ends meet.     But the reality is creating a dedicated funding source alone will not magically solve Metro's woes—we also need governance reforms. I support Senator Feldman and Delegate Korman's attempt to introduce more accountability to the WMATA Board.

      "response": "I oppose Governor Hogan's proposed road projects. The expansion of I-495, I-270, and BW Parkway will encourage sprawl development, promote car dependency, and increase pollution. Crucially, the governor's plans will also fail to achieve any of the promised congestion relief. Widening highways yields only temporary congestion relief because of induced demand—more lanes cause more people to drive than before. In the nineties, we saw this strategy fail on I-270 itself.     I will oppose sprawl development at every opportunity. I have stood alongside organizations like the Coalition for Transit Alternatives to Mid-County Highway Extended (TAME) to fight against M-83. I've also opposed the second Potomac River crossing, which would threaten the agricultural reserve, destroy neighborhoods, and erect a boondoggle that would induce more congestion.     As a former board member of the Action Committee for Transit, I absolutely support bold investments in Maryland's transit infrastructure. With bond rates still low, a massive transit infrastructure program is a win-win-win: We provide alternatives to congestion, create good-paying jobs, and reduce harmful emissions. I support the above transit priorities, and would add an expansion of the Red Line north from Glenmont to Olney, with stops in Aspen Hill and in Leisure World."

My district includes many of the most dangerous roads for pedestrians and cyclists in the county, including US-29, MD 355, Shady Grove Road, Norbeck Road, and Veirs Mill Road. Yet the SHA has continually thumbed its nose at Montgomery County residents' concerns about pedestrian safety. The SHA has refused to mark crosswalks in instances when cars would be inconvenienced, and even ignored the recommendations of its own pedestrian audit because it was not sufficiently car-centric. In recent years, the SHA has joined highway industry groups to lobby in Annapolis against common-sense bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists.     I will absolutely support changes to SHA oversight and policies. We must push SHA in the direction of structural overhauls on dangerous roads, rather than merely conducting education initiatives that often end up blaming the victims.

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Absolutely. I have been a steadfast advocate for the Purple Line, and know that it will improve the lives of many working families in Montgomery County. However, the Purple Line will also yield displacement if proactive, aggressive measures are not taken to preserve and build more affordable housing along the corridor. We must ensure that existing residents can enjoy the benefits of the Purple Line without being pushed out or cost burdened.    Affordable housing should be a right of every Marylander. First, I will champion funding for a community land trust to provide affordable housing by owning land and leasing it to those living in residential buildings on the land. This tool has preserved affordability in other parts of the country, including Albuquerque, New Mexico. Second, to ensure the existing rental housing stock is both affordable and safe, I will advocate for changes in property taxation procedures to allow for the establishment of differential taxation rates for land and structures; this would eliminate the implicit tax penalty associated with property improvements. Third, I will fight to expand Montgomery County's successful right of first refusal legislation to the entire state. Finally, even if it is not directly within my purview as a Delegate, I will use my public platform to support reducing parking minimums, expanding inclusionary zoning requirements, and upzoning areas near light-rail stations.

      "question": "Our region shares many things: a transit system, a housing market, even a football team. Would you like to see Maryland, Virginia, and DC collaborate to avoid a race to the bottom? How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Cooperation, rather than competition, is in the region's mutual best interest. As Delegate, I will do everything I can to encourage the three jurisdictions to collaborate instead of battling each other to give away the largest package of taxpayer dollars. In a race to the bottom, the “winner” usually ends up losing.     Delegate David Moon's strategy on a possible new stadium is the way forward on these regional issues. He teamed up with counterparts in Virginia and DC to bar public spending on incentives for a new NFL stadium. The bill has unfortunately not gotten traction this session, but I look forward to co-sponsoring it next year, when the General Assembly will feature many new members.    Moon's approach should be expanded to the battle for Amazon's second headquarters, where it appears that one of the world's most profitable companies is successfully pitting jurisdictions against one another to boost profits for its shareholders and executives. Billions handed to Amazon to outbid a regional competitor are billions that cannot be used to shore up our transit infrastructure, fund our schools, or address rising healthcare costs. Competition between the three jurisdictions is definitely good for Bezos and Snyder, but it's not good for Marylanders, District residents, and Virginians.    Finally, we must cooperate across jurisdictions if we are going to fix and stabilize Metro. Every Metro line crosses at least one jurisdictional boundary, and most Metro commuters need to cross jurisdictions to get to work. Public sparring between the leaders of the three jurisdictions over funding does nothing to improve residents' commutes or lives.  "

      "question": "Do you support Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) along U.S. 29, including the proposal to extend dedicated lanes south of New Hampshire Avenue into downtown Silver Spring, even if this means removing or narrowing general purpose lanes in some locations?",
      "response": "I believe we must create a comprehensive transit and road infrastructure plan that reduces traffic congestion, pollution, and provides greater accessibility and connectivity for residents all around our county. This will also connect people to jobs (thus fostering greater economic security) and connect businesses to their employees and customers (thus helping our local economy).    Specifically, a comprehensive plan requires understanding the varying needs of county residents, both UpCounty and DownCounty. ​These communities face different transportation issues, thus require different solutions. As such, I support the Purple Line, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT), limited roadway investments like M-83 and the expansion of I-270, as well as designated bike lanes and sidewalks.     I believe we must increase resources for programs that support the BRT, as I am an advocate for its expansion (Rockville Pike, New Hampshire Ave, Georgia Ave). I believe expanding the BRT will reduce congestion and pollution, while making our communities more accessible, particularly for our residents without cars.     By making our communities more accessible, I believe the BRT network will promote economic growth by connecting MoCo residents to more employment opportunities, while promoting a transportation infrastructure that will attract more employers to our county.     I also believe we should extend dedicated lanes into downtown Silver Spring with reversible bus-only lanes. While this would slightly shrink the size of the travel lane and medium, it removes the need to create two separate bus lanes, helps reduce speeding (thus making it safer for pedestrians and bikers) and, of course, increases continued access for those trying to commute to downtown Silver Spring. I also believe we must guarantee more pedestrian crosswalks and better timed traffic light signals, thus supporting our Vision Zero goals.      In addition to the BRT, I also support smart growth centered around transit centers. I support bikeway access to all Metro and Purple Line stations, as well as an overall bicycle master plan. This includes designated bike lanes, sidewalks, and more crosswalks, especially in high traffic areas, near schools, and near public recreation facilities."

      "question": "Are you committed to implementation of Vision Zero (zero traffic deaths)? What is the most important change to the roadways, law, or DOT practices that could bring about Vision Zero?",
      "response": "The Vision Zero program, launched last year, will direct resources toward initiatives that help reduce severe and fatal collisions involving vehicle occupants, bicyclists and pedestrians. To truly implement Vision Zero, I support smart growth centered around transit centers that prioritizes accessibility.     For example, I would make it safer and easier for the residents near the Forest Glen Metro to access the metro station without having to dangerously cross 6 lanes of traffic. This is especially dangerous at night or when there is rain. We need to take a deeper look at all our current metro stations and ensure we are encouraging ridership by making these stations safe and easy to access. We must create more walkable communities.     I support bikeway access to all Metro and Purple Line stations, as well as an overall bicycle master plan. This includes designated bike lanes, sidewalks, and more crosswalks, especially in high traffic areas, near schools, and near public recreation facilities.     I believe we must also leverage the actions taken and lessons learned from cities and states around this country to determine additional and innovative solutions. For example, I am currently in contact with the Smart City Project Manager for the City of Denver on ideas to strengthen pedestrian and vehicle safety in our cities. In Denver, they are in the process of installing devices in their city vehicles to track traffic in real-time. The idea is that by using this data, they can improve traffic light signals and pedestrian crosswalk timing. This, in turn, will reduce traffic congestion and increase safety.     I will believe we must support a comprehensive transit and road infrastructure plan to reduce traffic congestion, and will also work with our state delegation to advocate for additional funding for increased transportation safety measures from Annapolis."

      "question": "Montgomery County has many proposed transportation projects, including a county-wide Bus Rapid Transit network, the Corridor Cities Transitway, MARC expansion, widening of I-495 and I-270, Midcounty Highway (M-83), Montrose Parkway East, and more. With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "As noted in the above answer, I believe a comprehensive transit and road infrastructure plan will help connect people to jobs (thus fostering greater economic security) and connect businesses to their employees and customers (thus helping our local economy).    As it relates to paying for these investments, we must be mindful of how we balance this budget while not cutting essential services and critical programs that people come to this county for.  I will prioritize the programs that take into consideration the needs of both residents in DownCounty and UpCounty. This includes those programs that have the most immediate effects on reducing congestion and pollution (like the BRT and CCT), as well programs that were already promised to residents years ago through county-approved master plans (like a limited expansion of M-83). All of these are investments in the future of our residents, our community and our economy.     As it relates to increasing revenue sources to expand the level of services our county provides, I believe that, while we should not take raising and lowering taxes off the table as valid strategies, we cannot simply tax our way out of our problems. Any long term solution must include the retention and expansion of our tax base to strengthen our local economy.    We have an increasing number of older residents who are retiring. These residents are a key element of our county's success; often, they have lived the majority of their lives here, raising children and investing years in the county we all call home. As such, I would encourage zoning that would include and/or allow a variety of affordable multi-unit, multi-income developments such as apartments, accessory-dwelling, and cohousing. This would allow our older citizens who wish to move out of single family homes to continue to live in the communities they have spent the majority of their life, as well as allow newer residents to gain a foothold into our communities.     We also need more job training and career development programs -- similar to the ones provided by Workforce Montgomery and Montgomery College -- which will diversify our workforce, help businesses and nonprofits find the skilled workers they need, and provide more career and professional development opportunities for our young people. Through my work in President Obama's Office of Presidential Personnel, I was tasked with diversifying the political appointee workforce and creating a career readiness and mentorship program for over 100 newly appointed recent college graduates. I understand the importance of creating and implementing these programs for our county.     Finally, we must assist small businesses who might face short-term displacement by new and upcoming development projects. Specifically, we must provide these businesses with better notifications on upcoming projects/closures and assist them with relocation and marketing to current customers. We can accomplish this by working closely with the Economic Development Corporation.    By creating vibrant communities that are attractive and affordable for both older residents and newcomers, Montgomery County can truly expand the tax base, thereby lessening the tax burden on all and strengthening our local economy."

      "question": "To meet the need for homes in Montgomery County as identified by the county's recent Rental Housing Study, would you support zoning changes to streamline approval for multifamily housing and with reduced minimum parking requirements within 1/2 mile of Metro and 1/4 mile of Purple Line, MARC, and BRT stations?",
      "response": "Yes - I believe our county should emulate the model taken in Arlington County, where multifamily housing buildings nearest transit centers have fewer parking spots. Residents here should fully leverage their proximity to transit.     I believe, however, this will only be sustainable if we provided the necessary transportation infrastructure so that residents are able to easily and safely access those transit centers from their building. As such, we must expand bike parking, have protected and designated bike lanes, ensure crosswalks are protected and that traffic light signals are timed properly.     It is also important to note that parking lots take up space that could be more productively used as green space, retail space or additional housing to accommodate the needs of our community. This is also better for our environment, as the increased in walkability/biking will reduce the need for impervious pavement, increase green space and increase car-sharing.    "

      "question": "The county's recent Rental Housing Study noted that 38% of the rental housing demand is from households below 50% AMI, but only 19% of housing is affordable at that level. How would you like to see the county close this gap?",
      "response": "We must make it more affordable for residents, employees and employers to live in Montgomery County. This need will be exacerbated as the county is on the verge of some dynamic growth and development, which could potentially further the deficit of affordable housing.     During my tenure as the Deputy White House Liaison for President Obama and Secretary Julián Castro at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, I learned how a person's zip code should never determine a person's success. As such, I support a number of protections that would keep rents affordable for Montgomery County's most vulnerable residents and avoid displacing tenants.     I support legislation that strengthens our county's MPDU program and requires that at least 15% of new housing developments, not just 12.5%, be affordable. We must ensure we are expanding access to every resident of Montgomery County.  It is important to me that those who work in our county are able to live and raise their families in our county as well. And for those who have incomes too high to be eligible to participate in the MPDU program, I would support our county's Workforce Housing Program to continue keeping housing affordable. I support smart-growth with mixed-used development, and affordable housing is a critical component of this type of development.     I believe we must also increase the stock of affordable housing throughout the entire county. One way to do this is by increasing the percentage of our taxes that goes to funding the Housing Initiative Fund (HIF). Currently, the Fund receives a dedicated 2.5% of the County's property tax revenue. I would support increasing this percentage and working with the County Executive, fellow Councilmembers and the Planning Board to ensure we have affordable options in every council district.      Montgomery County currently does not exercise reasonable annual rent increase caps, except in the incorporated city of Takoma Park. I believe we should explore expanding these caps to the entire county, especially at affordable housing properties and those located near mass transit.    Additionally, I support “Just-Cause” protections for our renters. Currently, responsible tenants can find themselves completely vulnerable to retaliatory eviction or finding that their leases will not be renewed without any just cause, regardless of how long they have lived in their homes. As such, I support legislation - similar to the one Delegate Jheanelle Wilkins has recently helped move to committee in Annapolis, and similar to the protections provided in D.C., New York, Seattle and Chicago - that requires landlords to provide a stated and legal reason not to renew a lease. I believe these types of “Just-Cause” protections will not only provide needed confidence and economic stability to our working families, seniors and those with fixed and low incomes, but could also increase the marketability and attractiveness of a landlord's property."

      "response": "As it relates to the old Silver Spring Library, I would be interested in working with Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, the Montgomery County Planning Board, the residents in the surrounding neighborhoods and others to determine the best use of the site.     While the county just decided to convert the building into a childcare center, I believe they should have, instead, converted the building into both a childcare center and an affordable housing apartment complex for seniors and those on fixed or low-income. Traditionally, we tend to only build affordable housing units in areas that are significantly far away from employment, transit centers, shopping areas and public services. That is what the county just agreed to. But this is not conducive to a healthy and productive community and is the opposite of smart growth.     Given the increased cost of living, we are finding that too many of our senior residents are being priced out of our cities. These residents are key elements of our county's success, as many have spent the majority of their lives living in our communities, raising children here and investing in our local economy. Now, we have an obligation to ensure they are able to remain in the neighborhoods they helped built.   "

      "question": "Many Montgomery County candidates say they want to see more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions. Whose voices do you think are under-represented now, and why? What would you do to help those voices be heard?",
      "response": "I will host community town-hall meetings throughout the county where residents (in DownCounty as well as UpCounty, and West County as well as East County) are able to share their concerns directly to their elected officials. I will proactively include various community leaders, stakeholder groups, business and labor organizations, parents and students in the county's governing process. This includes making sure that we are not only reaching out to these organizations turing the time of the county budget, but before, during, after and throughout the entire year. We must have continual dialogue, and we must ensure this dialogue is accessible for all our residents. Therefore, we must also expand language access and translation services, hire diverse county staff members that represent the communities in which we serve, and take the time to actually listen before taking action.     As a first generation American, a product of MCPS, and a native of Montgomery County who has lived in 4 of the 5 council districts (in both the eastern and western parts of our county, as well as UpCounty and DownCounty), I have noticed how not everyone has the same or equal access to opportunity.     I have found that the concerns of those who live in UpCounty and East County, those who are immigrants, those who are not native English speakers, those who are high school students, and those who are retired or living on fixed-income are often marginalized and not given the same level of consideration as others in the county.     Here are 3 specific examples:    1. I went to both Glen Haven Elementary and Wayside Elementary. One is in the Silver Spring area and was a Title 1 school with over 70% kids on FARM; the other is in the Potomac area and had ample resources. Even as a 9-year-old, I noticed a big difference between the two schools as far as the number of after-school programs, number of children who had high levels of food insecurity, number of language immersion programs, and opportunities for one-on-one time between students and teachers.     2. The county once created a Master Plan for the UpCounty area and encouraged the growth of housing, businesses and schools. However, it failed to fulfill its promise of the required transportation infrastructure, thus hindering future economic growth.     3. In my recent conversations with parents in Poolesville, I found that Poolesville High School has had serious infrastructure problems - mold on ceilings, few if any windows in classrooms - that have been unresolved. These issues are not only causing serious health concerns for these students, but it also places them at a competitive disadvantage with students from other parts of the county. Schools like this should be prioritized and provided the funds necessary to expand services and provide these students with the education systems they deserve. However, they are instead taken off the priority funding list.     As such, I understand the importance of engaging and empowering our communities.     Through my work with President Obama in his White House and on his campaigns, I've engaged and empowered communities here in Montgomery County for the last 10 years. And I've seen how much good can come from politics. I ran efforts to increase the diversity in our government, get people access to affordable housing and affordable healthcare, and build grassroots support for NIH resulting in billions of dollars for cancer research.    I now want to bring that same level of commitment to the community I was born and raised in by making our elected institutions more representative, responsive, inclusive and accountable. And as someone who has lived in the county at-large and organized the county at-large, I understand how to do just that.      And that's what my campaign is all about. That's why our progressive, people-focused campaign has been endorsed by SEIU Local 500, the former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, President Obama's former National Field Director Jon Carson, Run for Something, the former President of the Women's Democratic Club of Montgomery County Linda Kolko, over 540 individual donors and 553 volunteers."

Numerous times over the last ten years, I have met with residents, DOT and SHA staff to advocate for pedestrian safety improvements. I recently met personally with State Highway Administrator Greg Slater and our Planning staff about pedestrian safety improvements on US 29, MD 97 and MD 198. Several of the requests I made included narrowing traffic lanes to slow down traffic, providing HAWK signals at key intersections, automating walk signals and expanding or redesigning pedestrian refuge areas - following up on a long letter detailing those suggested improvements. And I've been communicating frequently with the leaders of the Dale Drive Pedestrian Safety Coalition. Working with them, I had already won from DOT a commitment to improved signage, road markings, enhanced crosswalks, bump outs and shoulder repairs to be completed this summer. And just yesterday we also won a commitment for an additional $300,000 commitment from the County Executive for a study of long-term improvements to the topography of that road to improve pedestrian safety. I will bring that to the T&E Committee next week.    We also need to continue to invest in improved sidewalks, additional crosswalks, bike racks and lockers and protected bike lanes. Taken together, I believe these improvements will tremendously reduce pedestrian fatalities in our county and can serve as a model for pedestrian safety nationwide."

      "response": "I thought both proposals had merit. On balance, I supported the unique Gudelsky/CentroNia proposal to provide childcare for 120-150 children on-site and minimum 92 affordable housing units offsite because that seemed more of a win-win for the community. I believe that this is the best use of the site because it provides sorely needed childcare at a time when we have an affordable child care crisis - while preserving the limited but popular existing open space at that site. I think reasonable minds can disagree on the optimal disposition of that site. However, I have worked for over ten years with CentroNia, a nationally-recognized bilingual child care provider, including working with them in Annapolis to pass four bills to expand pre-K statewide. Given that CentroNia is interested - for the first time to my knowledge - in opening a new pilot program aimed at low-income residents in Silver Spring at a time when other child care centers are closing but the need is growing, and modeling that program for potential expansion in Montgomery County, to me that is a significant consideration.    Affordable housing is a huge priority for the County and for me in particular. I have consistently voted for sector plans and programs that incentivize or require developers to provide more affordable housing. There are many more sites in Silver Spring and countywide that are good candidates for increased affordable housing, and I will continue to work to make that a reality."

      "response": "I've spent my entire adult life as an activist and many years as a low-income community organizer. There is no question that communities of color, youth, tenants, transit riders, students, disabled and low-to-moderate-income residents generally are very under-represented in the county's land use and transportation decisions, not only in Montgomery County but all across the nation. There are many factors that contribute to that reality, including the likelihood that members of those communities are more likely to be caring for children,       There are so many things we could do to help those voices be heard. Here are just a few:  We could and should provide child care at evening hearings.   We can and should hold hearings all over the county, particularly where affected communities live. There's no reason we could have not held a BRT hearing in East County, near the affected population and current and future transit riders. It would have been much more relevant and appropriate than holding the only hearings in Rockville. If we can hold a budget forum and other events in East County, we can hold hearings there as well.  We could invest in real, culturally-appropriate community outreach. I was an early supporter of the creation of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, and I served as its Chair until I had to step down once I joined the Council. Its vision was to inform and solicit opinions from tenants about issues that affect them.   We can more routinely invest in outreach around particular projects. I strongly supported the money we programmed for outreach for BRT, because we intended it to be spent on organizing, doorknocking, community meetings and materials. Instead much of it was spent on water bottles, t-shirts, pizza cutters, flash drives and other promotional items. That was a missed opportunity that built the BRT's brand without informing residents of the potential benefits.  We could seek more input from community organizations serving those communities regarding how to support the voices of their members, particularly those we regularly support. We invest in IMPACT Silver Spring and many other organizations, but we don't ask them to survey members on the BRT, for example, or to bring members to a hearing to testify.  We could seek and allow more input from residents via skype, twitter and other means for residents who are home with kids during evening hearings. If radio and TV interviewers can routinely accept questions and comments delivered via other platforms, we can as well.  This is one reason I co-sponsored Bill 41-16 to establish a Community Zoning and Land Use Resource Officer that would do outreach to communities and better help them understand the process.     Thanks for the opportunity to share my thoughts, and please continue to provide your very valuable guidance on issues before the Council."

      "response": "The State should take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits. I will support a policy of smart growth which include making the areas more compact and relying more on mass transit. This will include building neighborhoods where essential services and social activities are located within short distances. I will strongly support a policy that will shape travel behavior by residents of transit rich neighborhoods, promoting walking, biking, and transit use and discouraging driving. This policy will be aimed at attracting core and potential transit riders, support zero vehicle households; and reduce the availability of parking."

Pulling resources together to attract major investments to the area should be encouraged to avoid competition that will affect development. Transportation projects that bring together multiple jurisdictions are better received by federal government than when jurisdictions pitch separate projects. having Maryland, Virginia and DC working together to address the region's important economic development issues is a powerful asset for growing and attracting business in the region. The collaboration will connect the region through unity. The unity can be maximized through region-wide coordination on key strategic priorities, including infrastructure and workforce development.

      "question": "Do you think the current accessory dwelling process is working well? Do you support the County Board's recent changes? Would you expand it to allow converting existing garages or other structures? What other changes would you make?",
      "response": "Accessory dwellings present an opportunity to help meet the need for housing in Arlington in an innovative, affordable way. The current accessory dwelling process is not working as well as it should. Only 20 accessory dwelling units have been approved in the County over the last decade since the 2008 Ordinance was first approved. Given the opportunity that Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) present for our seniors, as they age in place, as well as all ages who may want to live in this type of housing, we need to make the process easier.    I supported the changes that the ADU Ordinance proposed, but was disappointed that the Board voted for further study of part of the ordinance after so much consideration. Doing so only slowed down the relief needed by making this type of housing available to more of our residents and was not merited in this case. ADUs have the potential to ease pressures on housing and provide places to live that are convenient and livable. They can only do so if owners feel they can obtain permission to build with a reasonable regulatory burden. The Housing Commission and the working group on accessory dwelling put a lot of work into this. I believe the Board's concerns regarding proliferation of ADUs at a rate that would be too great is not consistent with the 20 ADUs that have been approved.      Yes, I would support expanding the ADU ordinance to allow conversions of existing garages and other structures. Allowance for existing structures would benefit those most in need of this additional housing option. There are protections in place that would make the use of existing structures reasonable: limitations on the number of occupants and square footage. We should allow existing structures that fit within these criteria so that ADUs become a practical tool that we can use to address aging in place and meet the challenges we face over the years to come.    I believe we should consider the current deed restriction component to the ordinance and whether ADUs should be permitted for short-term lodging. I believe we should do so with appropriate review under the short-term rental ordinance, but the debate to this point has been overly concerned about rapid proliferation of the ADU ordinance while only 20 have been approved over the last 10 years. The vision on ADUs has not matched the need for more options to serve our seniors and Arlingtonians interested in practical solutions. Allowing services like Airbnb, with proper controls, would empower our senior residents to earn supplemental income, but not be so widespread as to address our region's housing crunch. We need to find an approach that is balances the real changes, challenges and opportunities we face as a community."

      "question": "Arlington adopted an affordable housing master plan in 2015 which sets a goal of 600 new units per year and 17% of housing affordable to people making 60% of AMI or less. What would you do to ensure it reaches those goals?",
      "response": "Both innovative approaches to developing new units and consistent commitment to the goals put forth in the Affordable Housing Master Plan are necessary to meet the goal of 600 units. The big picture challenge is that Market Rate Affordable Units are being redeveloped as units that are not affordable at 60% or, in many cases, 80% of Area Median Income (AMI).       As far as innovative approaches, I would explore fully the conversion of unused and underused commercial properties into affordable housing. The commercial vacancy rate ticked back up over the past year to 19.7%. We must be realistic about the office space challenges we have and are likely to have over the years to come. In some cases conversion of office space with waiver of parking requirements could be used to provide affordable units at reduced costs.     Another innovative approach we should use is to reduce site plan conditions for new affordable housing construction. This approach along with several others were identified in the report submitted to the County Board by leaders of the affordable housing community titled Fulfilling the Promise: Meeting the Production Goal of Arlington's Affordable Housing Master Plan. I would consider reductions in site plan conditions and, in particular, parking requirements for affordable housing projects, as I have specifically considered these two items in my capacity on the Arlington Housing Commission.     Other innovative approaches mentioned in Fulfilling the Promise that I would specifically want to use would include a combination of reduced permit and tap fees, and waiving permit conditions as well as additional resources for AHIF. I would not necessarily support each of the recommendations in Fulfilling the Promise, but I would consider them and the report in light of the importance of housing affordability as a shared Arlington value.    Two specific additional innovative approaches to consider would be community land trusts, which have been successfully used outside the Commonwealth and are being considered in other communities here in Virginia. A second recommendation that I think is worthy of debate is general obligation bonds in support of affordable housing. Other Arlington valued amenities such as schools and parks are supported by bonds. We should consider whether affordable housing is something that voters should consider as well.     In addition to innovative approaches to reach the goal of 600 units, consistent commitment to the resources to reach the goal would be needed. The Affordable Housing Investment Fund (“AHIF”), the County's main financing program for affordable housing development has helped to create the majority of Arlington's nearly 7,500 approved affordable rental units that benefit low- and moderate-income households. We must point out that this is a revolving loan fund and that the economic multiplier effect of this program are significant, along with the community benefits. Once we have done so, we should support increases in AHIF. Doing so should not be done in a vacuum, but we have not been close to the goal of 600 units in the last two budgets and we must work to close the gap.      Preservation of existing units would also be necessary to meet the goal. As a result, I supported Housing Conservation Districts (HCD) as a means of protecting garden style apartments with a recommendation that the second phase of the benefits be developed within one year. There is a community benefit to keeping the units in garden style apartments and we should develop a fair, efficient process for evaluating that benefit along with property owner's development interests."

      "question": "How would you approach the future of the Lee Highway area? How would you manage the transitions between property on Lee Highway directly and the nearby single-family areas? Would you support transportation changes that improve bus and/or bicycle access even if it might slow down single-passenger car traffic?",
      "response": "Lee Highway is one of several areas in Arlington County that could benefit from more investment over the years to come. The Lee Highway Visioning Study represents thoughtful work done by the people most directly affected by the development of the Lee Highway corridor and I would listen carefully to the ideas therein. From my initial assessment of the work to this point, some guiding principles have been agreed upon. Other issues of density and building heights still need further conversation.      As far as guiding principles, enhanced streetscaping, undergrounding of utilities, a desire for more open space, improved parking, enhanced bus transit, and both affordable housing and affordable commercial strategies are just a few. Structural problems that need to be addressed include insufficient sidewalks without room for trees and shade, narrow parcel sizes. There is also a need for tapering of any new taller buildings to limit the impact on adjacent neighborhoods, and streets that negatively affect the safety of the corridor.    Overall, a reasonable increase in density within the mixed-use villages (building on historical development patterns and existing commercial areas) appears warranted in order to meet the goals of a more economically vibrant, walkable, attractive, livable Lee Highway corridor for all ages. However, the high cost of the approval process, including rezoning costs and site plan conditions, can result in participation only by those who can afford it, excluding many small, local property owners and developers. We need to be conscious of that as we move forward. We also must be conscious of how investments in the Lee Highway area must be done with full consideration of the communities impacted along Lee Highway and in balance with needs of South Arlington and across the County as a whole.    With respect to managing the transitions between the property on Lee Highway and nearby single family areas, the Lee Highway Visioning study provides some ideas that have been used in other parts of the County that I support. For example, step downs in terms of height from the Highway to neighborhoods are appropriate. Considering the context and scale of the parts of Lee Highway slated for development is also important: Fire Station Number 8's historical importance should be preserved; there are nodes along Lee Highway that are more appropriate for mixed use development.      As far as transportation, I don't currently believe the data shows there is enough of a need for transportation changes that might slow down single passenger traffic, but I would want to take a deeper look at the data over the years to come. If the data were to support it in the future, I would be open to transportation changes that might reduce the speed of single-passenger car traffic. Such transportation would need to be accompanied by improved bus and bike resources that make changes worthwhile for the greatest numbers of our residents."

      "question": "What do you think is the best way to improve mobility in the Columbia Pike corridor? Would you support changes that improve bus and/or bicycle access even if it might slow down single-passenger car traffic?",
      "response": "The Pike is Arlington's most transited bus corridor with 17,000 boarding a day. Despite this fact, levels of service leave a lot to be desired. Improvements deserve immediate attention and I would support bus service that reduces intervals and increases capacity. Improved bus service means constant and reliable service. Arlington should lead the region and deliberately pursue off-vehicle fare collection on the Pike (to speed-up boarding and reduce bunching), multi-door buses and signal priority for public transit (in order to stabilize schedules).    Arlington should also study and test smart lane signaling to prioritize public transit when needed and appropriate. The Pike meets the necessary conditions for smart signaling, has the ridership demand to justify such an innovative approach and smart bus service was promised four years ago, making these improvements long overdue. This work should be accelerated, along with implementation of the bus station improvement plan.     In the long term, integrating ART and Metro bus service with as many alternative transit modes as possible at station locations will be key. Pike riders should be able to seamlessly “hop\" from their bus on a bike, a shared drive or a local shuttle at dedicated pick-up and drop off facilities integrated in a transit hub. The Pike's existing commercial nodes at high-traffic intersections are great candidates for initial implementation of such hubs.     As far as cycling, I believe the existing parallel path to the Pike Bike boulevards need to be further expanded in order to Pentagon City to the east, to the W&OD Trail to the west, and to the West end of the Pike. Additional bike lane and path connections should be considered for investment based on analysis of data with respect to need and projected usage. Finally, pedestrian mobility must also be a priority. Fixing sidewalks, providing adequate public lighting, and reviewing intersections for safety are all important on the many walkable portions of the Pike.     As far as transportation and single passenger car traffic, if the data continues to support it--which I believe it currently does--I would support transportation changes that might reduce the speed of single-passenger car traffic. However, such changes would need to be accompanied by the resources in the form of bus hubs and dedicated bike resources to make the new system efficient and worthwhile for the greatest numbers of residents living in the corridor."

      "question": "What areas of the budget should be targeted for reduction and which should be protected from cuts, given the county board's no tax increase direction?",
      "response": "As far as reductions, the County Manager's proposed budget includes several reductions that I agree with, including the reductions in the Pay-As-You-Go capital budget, which reduces funding for paving after improvements in the overall condition of roads as measured by the County. The provision of lab services to Department of Human Services clients through contractors is another reduction I support. Altogether, these cuts would add up to $2 million in cuts. The other recommended cuts and revenue increases in the County Manager's budget make sense to me, with the exception of the cuts to AIRE program in the Department of Environmental Services. I believe in energy efficiency benefits are worth the investment, both for our economy and for families, as well as to fulfill our Community Energy Plan and address climate change locally.      As far as protecting areas from cuts, I agree with the County Manager's recommendation for investment in the Police Department and Fire Department staff in light of a significant short-term increase in retirements, which should be met by increases in pay to honor our police and address the need for more officers. Not only is this a critical sector for our well being, but we are currently underspending on public safety compared to our neighboring counties. I also believe we must protect sound, cost-benefit investments in economic development, since the commercial vacancy rate has ticked back up this year. We should be driven by the best estimates of benefits and costs of commercial tenants--neither subsidizing big business on a whim nor ignoring the importance of our commercial tax base in keeping Arlington's services high and costs low. I also would protect housing from cuts, consistent with the goals articulated in the Affordable Housing Master Plan.     Finally, I would add that I would have supported advertising a half cent property tax increase, as proposed by Christian Dorsey and Libby Garvey. I do not believe that the legislation in Richmond that would require Arlington to reduce the assessment of golf course revenue is in our best interest as a County. Taxpayers should not be asked to pay more for facilities that are already in very good financial shape. Until we know if this legislation will become law and to determine if small additional funding measures are necessary, it would have been wise to advertise a half cent tax increase and engage in a robust debate of our budget priorities."

      "question": "If Virginia provides more money to Metro, there's a strong possibility that NVTA local funds will be redirected to this goal. If that happens, what would be your priorities for reductions in the county's transportation capital plan?",
      "response": "The question is a difficult one that would require significant analysis over the coming months. I offer my thoughts based on analysis of the County's CIP and conversations with the Chair of the Transportation Commission, among others, but suspect that the change that could occur through the legislature is significant enough that the County as a whole would need to spend significant time determining next steps.      Here's where I would focus at the outset.     - The 2017 through 2026 Capital Improvement Plan includes significant funding for Metro entrances. I believe the Commonwealth's permanent funding for Metro would not include some of the entrances proposed. Where Metro operates effectively with one entrance, I would consider delaying the construction of new entrances to be able to continue to fund other services.     - Reductions in the Commuter Store Program. I agree that learning the benefits of commuting are beneficial, but see investments in improved bus service along Columbia Pike as a higher priority.     - Reduced funding for the street lighting programs and instead prioritize funding for street improvements to improve traffic flow across the county. The program's not popular and I would want to better understand the benefits before providing additional funding.     - Finally, ART bus service that supplements Metro lines is another natural area where reevaluation and possible capital reductions might be necessary.     I would take each of these steps with a focus on data and an understanding that some transportation investments may result in improved commercial activity, such as investments in reliable bus service that can attract new regional consumers. I would also want to consider the impact of weak office space demand, increased prevalence of teleworking options and the results, once announced, of the Amazon decision."

      "response": "Yes, I support dedicated bondable funding for Metro at least $500 Million a year including $167 Million from Maryland. My wife and I are daily metro riders, we believe a safe reliable metro system is the driving force for development in the greater Washington metro area. To create dedicated funding for WMATA I would be in support of WMATA Assessment Districts (WAD), creating Rental Car fees, creating a carbon tax, and closing corporate loop holes.  In references to WADs having successful examples, such as what took place with the Silver Line in Fairfax County are feasible solutions for Maryland. We can look to our counterparts in Northern Virginia for a blueprint. Fairfax county is similarly situated to Montgomery county; thus, there can be an audience amongst the Montgomery County delegation for such measures as WADs. I would navigate the politics by relying on successful past practices and using personal capital to build a public campaign to create pressure on officials. The rental car fees are fees are likely to be less controversial issue, because it is not a direct increase on Marylanders. I think it is imperative labor have a seat at the table when determining the direction of the Metro. Labor should have an active role formulating how legislators will acquire dedicated funding and how it will be spent."

How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "Through having access to current data, we can assess the demand for affordable housing in all parts of the city. The demand for affordable housing would dictate the allocation of the production of affordable housing within prioritized areas of the city. The responsibility of the council is to ensure that the city is holding the Department of Housing and Community Development, the Office on Planning, and the private industry accountable for meeting the demand for affordable housing across the city. Mechanisms such as HPAP and DC Opens Doors are accessible tools to absorb a portion of the population in pursuit of affordable housing by converting qualified renters into homeowners. Strategically, preserving affordable housing by distributing tax abatements to encourage the production and preservation of affordable housing in order to compete with the development of market rate housing.   The creation and preservation of affordable housing is my highest priority in my pursuit of the Ward 1 seat on the DC Council. Additionally, the rights of tenants should be protected through the incentives provided by the Department of Housing and Community Development. Mechanisms such as reimbursements for title-work, legal fees, recordation of taxes, or down-payment assistance can entice prospective purchasers to preserve affordable housing units. There are a wealth of opportunities to structure financial incentives.   I support all updates to the comprehensive plan which incorporate the progressive ideas outlined above."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "I support the initiative to incorporate protected bike and bus lanes strategically and at appropriate scale based on data reflecting traffic patterns over time. Developing solutions to the issue of proliferate automobile congestions is essential to the long term success for the city, with bus and bike lanes being key to this goal, however, it is imperative to incorporate the present needs of those residents who are unable to benefit from these lanes and alternatives to driving. In areas of the District where there are vital offices which provide social services such as the Office on Aging, and Service Centers for the Department of Health and Human Services bike and bus lanes should not be created in exchange for removing parking that is accessed by the elderly, parents and/or residents with physical challenges. The equivalent applies for for establishments of public use ie. grocery stores, hospitals, etc. It is critical as leaders in the Nation's Capital, to continue to advocate for the rights and needs of all residents, that we thoughtfully consider where and when we create protected bike and bus lanes so as to increase the accessibility of the city for all residents and not hinder it for those with the greatest need.

      "response": "Bondable financing for the Metro System across this region is essential to updating the infrastructure of the transit system so long as DC does not contribute the largest percentage of the $500 million. While residents of all three municipalities utilize the system, in terms of ridership, DC residents utilize the system less than Virginia and Maryland residents. Additionally, the proximity to and accessibility of the District creates the desirability for residential and commercial development across the region. The attractions, services and resources the District offers Virginia and Maryland access to via the metro transit system should be accounted for in the division of requested funds."

      "response": "I am not in support of Tax Increment Financing that is not accompanied by the development of Affordable Units. Particularly, for property in a location like Union Market which is easily accessible via public transportation (New York Avenue Metro Station). If elected, I would ensure all projects requesting TIF credits appropriate these funds for the production of affordable housing and hold all parties accountable for said development.     Tax-increment Financing is an important tool that should be used out of necessity, not desire. It allows the District to provide funds for development projects by borrowing against future tax revenue. With that understanding, this was an unusual way to use Tax-increment financing, but it is not uncommon. A similar structure was used during the construction of the Target complex on 14th street. Moving forward, I am committed to using TIF as a tool to help build more affordable housing."

Job training and vocational programs, prepare a wider population of DC residents to be prepared to enter the workforce and prepare more residents to compete for higher paying jobs. Holding businesses accountable for hiring DC residents will also address the issue of unemployment.     In order to reduce the homeless population, through maximizing the efforts in place, increasing oversight, and maximizing the current efforts of the city to reduce homelessness will help to remedy this issue.    Ensuring that small businesses hire DC residents through a key factor - but incentivizing businesses/corporations in DC to hire underrepresented groups somehow? Any businesses/corporations looking to expand/develop in DC should be required to hire a percentage of hires from the district such as efforts already taken by the Department of Small and Local Business Development.

      "response": "The city's current budget surplus should be allocated to expand the budgeting for social services such as the DC Office on Aging, and for the upkeep and operation of homeless shelters and transitional housing. Retaining a percentage of all surplus dollars in the city's coffers would protect the city from dipping into a recession.     Should the city fall into recession, a swift strategy for economic stimulus across households, businesses, and governments would be an essential part of budget recovery. The budget recovery efforts on behalf of the Obama Administration were centered around job creation which increased the capacity for citizens to purchase goods and services, which increased the capacity for taxable transactions. Similarly, an increased focus on job training and vocational programs would play a large part of said stimulus.    "

      "response": "As we undertake a rebuilding of our nation's infrastructure, including our overly congested road system (the morning and afternoon Capital Beltway gridlocks will each grow to six hours by 2025), every decision we make must take into consideration the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians. In the Maryland General Assembly I have been a leading advocate for bicyclists. I successfully introduced legislation to establish the Task Force to Study Bicycle Safety on Maryland highways. The important work of this Task Force can be a transformative step in providing equal access to our road networks for cyclists. Working with Bike Maryland, I have also introduced much needed legislation to require drivers to come to a full stop for cyclists waiting to cross roadways at crosswalks. Furthermore, with pedestrian deaths at a 25 year high it is more important than ever that short, medium and long term road planning includes funding for incorporating pedestrian safety best practices.   Incentivizing public transit use begins at the city and county levels through transit-oriented development, transportation management planning requirements, and public transit discounts for local residents. At the federal level, we need to make sure that the Federal Transit Administration is providing the necessary funding for public transportation projects here in Maryland, including funds to fully implement the 81-mile Bus Rapid Transit system approved by the Montgomery County Council in 2013."

What do you favor and what would you oppose?",
      "response": "My preference is for dedicated revenue streams from tax fairness measures to pay for maintaining and expanding our infrastructure. In 2012, I successfully introduced the most progressive reform of the Maryland tax code in decades. Our work supported critical government services during the Great Recession by ensuring the wealthy paid their fair share. I'm also proud to be the only candidate running for the 6th Congressional District to in 2014 vote against cutting the estate tax- an unconscionable policy choice which will funnel over $1.1 billion to the wealthiest 0.2% in our state over the next ten years. By rolling back unreasonable provisions that solely benefit wealthy corporations enjoying record profits and the wealthiest of the wealthy, we can pay for a 21st century world-class infrastructure system that grows our economy and improves quality of life across the income spectrum.

Among the HUD programs at the top of my priority list is the Housing Trust Fund established as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. This critical program provides direct formula-based, federally-funded grants to states and local entities for the creation and rehabilitation of affordable housing opportunities for very low-income families. I fully support the expansion of this program. Additionally, I will prioritize ensuring the sustainability of HUD down payment and loan assistance programs. I believe that the federal government will be directly supporting making housing affordable when we raise the minimum-wage to $15.00/hour. I am a co-sponsor of Sen.

In addition, it has been my long held position that when evaluating new road construction projects (as opposed to road and intersection improvements), my preference is improving existing road capacity (such as I-270), as opposed to new road construction, given our ongoing funding constraints, the need to preserve green space, and the need to protect established communities."

      "question": "Prince George's County is the most dangerous in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. Why do you think this is? Is there a role for you in changing this?",
      "response": "Beyond the shocking headlines -- stretching from Langley Park to Marlow Heights to just down the street from the County Administration Building in Upper Marlboro -- lies a painful truth: for much of the past decade: Prince George's has been one of the most dangerous places in Maryland to be a bicyclist or a pedestrian.    As a cyclist, I ride roads and trails throughout the county—sometimes under very dangerous road conditions.  For years I would ride along Oxon Hill Road and other roadways in the area with my young son to run errands and to make my way to our national parks at Fort Foote, Fort Washington and Oxon Hill Farm. I even rode my bike to drop my son at daycare and then load my bike on a bike rack on a Metrobus—I could not afford a car.  Back in 2000, I am proud of my leadership to reinvent Oxon Hill Road – indeed I was once in a horrible almost life-altering accident along that road.  I organized our communities to develop a redesign of Oxon Hill Road with roundabouts, sidewalks, curb cuts for the homes along the road, and plenty of room for bike lanes and vehicles to share the road.  It took a long time and a lot of advocacy but today Oxon Hill Road is much safer and more beautiful because of our work as a community.     Everyone shares responsibility for avoiding serious injuries and fatalities on the road -- from buckling up and curbing the behaviors of aggressive drivers to reducing distracted/impaired driving and clearing roadways of debris to making our roadways amenities for the communities -- but for far too long we have been slow to take seriously the needs of the “mini-cities” or walkable urban communities, that have started to emerge in the County.    Each has its own physical characteristics, demographics, and placemaking needs -- and often that requires making roadways and street designs safer and more inclusive of the needs of pedestrians and cyclists to get around for all kinds of reasons (school, work, and play).    That's why I am supportive of the goals and the approach of the Prince George's Strategic Roadway Safety Plan, but also believe that it will take leadership and commitment -- including the courage to reverse decisions like $170 million in wasteful transportation spending the County has made at sprawling developments in Brandywine, Konterra, and Westphalia -- to make funding these strategies to make our roads safer for bicyclists and pedestrians a reality. We should also encourage and support more interior county development around our existing transportation infrastructure to decongest our roads, preserve our rural tier and protect our environment. Also, roads that are bikeable and walkable make for safer communities.    This leadership is not new for me, as my Congressional office worked for 3 years with community leaders inside the Beltway to secure $26.5 million from the Maryland State Highway Administration for long-neglected pedestrian safety improvements along Pennsylvania Avenue -- building new sidewalks, putting up more street lights, constructing a new hiker-biker trail, and installing a dedicated signal to make it safe for pedestrians to cross a 6-lane, divided state highway right next to Forestville Mall.    I will keep this commitment to protecting everyone's right to the road as County Executive."

Would you support extending The Bus service hours to better match what is provided by other jurisdictions?",
      "response": "The Bus is a critical component of the County's transportation network that often serves as a last-mile connection for those use transit in Prince George's, including workers and seniors.  I support extending The Bus hours to better match that of Metro -- including late evening and weekend service. I am also committed to expanding the reach of The Bus so that more communities are served that are not served by Metro and Metrobus. I fought for and won funding in the 2009 Economic Stimulus package for funding for additional energy efficient buses in The Bus system and my commitment will continue as County Executive.    For most of my career, I have stood with and fought for all working men and women to not only have access to better wages and benefits, but the supports that are necessary to be successful on and off the job.  That is why I am proud of have earned the support of a number of local labor unions in Prince George's -- including Unite HERE Local 25, which represents the workers at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center and MGM National Harbor, who have fought so hard to extend the same kind of bus service on routes that Metro oversees."

      "question": "Do you support Governor Hogan's proposal to widen I-495 and/or the B-W Parkway? Why or why not?",
      "response": "Indeed, when the Wilson Bridge was widened to eight lanes, the argument was that congestion would be reduced (today, there are more cars than ever).  As member of a coalition of civic leaders we fought for and won an engineering design that will support rail across the Wilson Bridge, which if done then or now would reduce congestion tremendously in that corridor.  The idea was rejected, principally by developers and road industry lobbyists, but it was a lesson learned too late.     In my view, widening I-495 or the Baltimore-Washington Parkway would simply lead to more congestion and sprawl -- which together will contribute to climate change and create more pollution in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed along with further taxing our existing public infrastructure.  Governor Hogan's proposal is just the kind of wasteful boondoggle I've pledged to end as County Executive, and I will do whatever I can to make sure his proposal is dead on arrival -- especially if it continues to use the regressive tool of High Occupancy Toll lanes as its primary funding source.    The Inter-County Connector, sometimes dubbed the road less traveled, is another example of billions spent while taking little, if any, pressure off the I-270 corridor. These type of toll roads are regressive, placing more economic pressure on lower income workers who must either pay the toll or pay the consequences of failing to invest in public transit.  We would be better positioned in the region to use our transportation dollars to expand and support transit and meet our regional commitment to Metro that is necessary for the system to operate as an engine for Maryland's economy."

      "response": "I am running for Prince George's County Executive because it's time to jumpstart the next era of opportunity for our neighbors through key investments in innovation, development, education, and an accountable and responsive County Government.     I believe we have a solid framework for an innovation corridor that can propel our local economy in the 21st Century.  I will work to leverage our County's “tech corridor” of the University of Maryland, Bowie State College, Prince George's Community College, Goddard Space Flight Center, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to grow an innovation economy here in Prince George's that can serve as a hub for a whole new generation of start-up businesses -- the next I-270 corridor  – with the right investments.    To grow the innovation economy in Prince George's, it is essential that we transform our education system and make transit-oriented development a cornerstone of our economic development future.    As a former analyst and project engineer in the space program as well as a former chair of the United States House of Representatives' Space Subcommittee, I understand and value the hidden technology secret of Prince George's County – we need to tell our story and invest in innovation incubators for cybersecurity, aerospace, earth science and other technologies. And, we have the tools to do just that.    Prince George's County is the birthplace of smart growth.  I was proud to receive the leadership award from the Coalition for Smarter Growth, Sierra Club, and the Landscape Architects Association for my work to try to bring rail over the Wilson Bridge, funding for the Purple Line, championing transit-oriented development, green infrastructure development for wastewater systems, and other work to create livable, walkable, workable communities.    But the reality of transit-oriented development in the County has not met our aspirations because of too little focus, perceptions of a pay-to-play culture, and the misdirection of public investment into wasteful spending on new highways in places far away from job centers, transit, established neighborhoods, and public facilities (be it schools, libraries, parks, or community centers).    Accelerating transit-oriented development (TOD) in Prince George's will require shifting public investment towards new transportation priorities – for example, simply choosing to not fund ONE of our recent sprawling, highway expansion projects in Brandywine, Konterra, or Westphalia could have created the equivalent of a $40-60 million capital fund to support the kind of streetscape improvements, pedestrian/bicycle safety initiatives, public facilities, and placemaking that could help more neighborhoods -- including the priority TOD sites of Branch Avenue, Largo Town Center, New Carrollton, and Suitland to grow into regional destinations anchored by existing transportation infrastructure (building upon the momentum created by the initial success that College Park, Hyattsville, and the Gateway Arts District have achieved in establishing the County's first walkable urban places)."

      "question": "The county is currently developing a Comprehensive Housing Strategy. What are your goals and priorities for that? How would you combat the problems of evictions and foreclosures?",
      "response": "Prince George's was slow to recover from the housing crisis and still suffers from a stubbornly high foreclosure rate nearly twice the average in Maryland, so it is important that the County continue to beef up its tools to help residents and non-profit service providers prevent foreclosures and redevelop problem properties.    Part of this involves reforming the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) allocation process to ensure that County Government can make sustained, long-term investments in building the capacity of affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization nonprofits and the other requires re-organizing how the County's tax collection, housing, code enforcement, and redevelopment agencies work together to rehabilitate distressed properties and put them back to productive use.     I have always believed in the power of organizing -- to create good jobs, accessible housing, and beautiful spaces for the public to enjoy.  That's why I am committed to negotiating project labor agreements and community benefits agreements for all large-scale development projects -- because these are tools that can be used to create the base of resources that are necessary to create and preserve affordable and workforce housing across Prince George's.    Finally, efforts to improve our housing market and neighborhoods should -- wherever possible -- not only focus on making our property values healthier, but the lives of our families and communities more sustainable too. In addition to mixed-use development supported by existing transportation infrastructure, I support mixed-income housing investments so that people are not pushed out of their traditional communities to accommodate development.  Mixed income communities are thriving communities.  I also support using incentives to encourage teachers, firefighters and police officers to live in the communities they serve.     That's why, as a member of Congress, I was proud to bring home $10 million in funding from the Transportation Infrastructure Investment Act of 2013 to make a portion of Branch Avenue right next to the Naylor Road Metro Station a complete street and why I support the continued funding of the Central Avenue Connector Trail because parks and open space amenities make it easier for everyone in our community to walk or bike for some of their daily activities -- creating a simple and economical way to get exercise and stay healthy without going to the gym."

      "response": "I support doing whatever we can to depoliticize the land use and development review process in Prince George's County.    As someone who started my work in local politics fighting a large development project that was proposed in my backyard, I know personally how much not only ‘who you know' and a ‘pay-to-play culture' influences decisions around major investment in Prince George's but also how much more say a small group of big donors and special interests have over the rest of us when it comes to approving new housing developments, building shopping centers, picking transportation projects, funding schools, and creating a walkable urban future.    In most jurisdictions in the Washington metropolitan area, elected officials have no involvement in reviewing individual development projects -- removing the election process from Prince George's zoning code would help to create the certainty that would encourage quality developers to invest in the County and make it less likely that County leaders will be accused of engaging in illegal or unethical behavior to benefit a property owner or their political interests.    I have decided I will not accept campaign contributions from developers because it is important for elected officials in the County to sever our financial ties from real estate interests so that we can be champions for the kind of development that all Prince Georgians deserve."

Legalizing Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) will help to accomplish all of these goals while bringing a largely unregulated form of housing off of the black market.

I support the governor's proposals; I however am concerned that it doesn't go far enough, for instance I-495 may have limited opportunities for expansion. I-270 could have reversible lanes which would be much more feasible and less intrusive both to homes and environment.  We should also consider long term transit options for north of Gaithersburg – be it along 270, increasing MARC train schedules or metro.  Transit in this area is a must and the CCT should be realigned to run down the middle of Shady Grove Road to the Shady Grove Station which would incentivize redevelopment of those properties and support the hospital and businesses already there.  In addition to expanding road networks, this is an opportunity to re-imagine the work place and begin to robustly institute teleworking mechanisms to relieve the roads of traffic. Advances in technology allow us to invest in this initiative.

Transit is supported in dense populations but much more difficult to justify in areas where populations are fewer and farther apart. I am sure it is a challenge. As I have shared previously, we must also explore options like telecommuting that keep commuters off the road."

      "question": "Prince George's County is the most dangerous in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. Why do you think this is? Is there a role for you in changing this?",
      "response": "I believe that this is due in large part to the culture of how transportation projects had been approved, the historical priority that had been placed on throughput (in many instances to accommodate motorists traveling through Prince George's County), much of which is along multi-lane State maintained arterials, and the culture of land-use.  This in turn resulted in a lack of focus on pedestrian and bicycle connectivity.  As the majority of pedestrian fatalities take place on State roads, more needs to be done to advocate for safe pedestrian passage on those roads. Pedestrian crashes on state roads is a rather large and unfortunate contributor to the issues that we are experiencing in Prince George's county.  So for starters, it is critical to focus on the 4 E's of pedestrian safety: Education, Enforcement, Engineering and Emergency Service.  A part of the solution rests in changing the paradigm and prioritizing the incorporation of design features into new projects and rehabilitation projects that provide safe passage to those traveling on foot and on bike. In addition, more needs to be done to educate the driving public of how to safely interact with those on foot and on bike."

      "response": "I would, though we should also be mindful of the fact that a fair amount of bus service in the county is provided by WMATA.  Having said that, the county does need to improve bus service.  In addition, the county must examine ways that it can help to facilitate the creation and sustainment of Transit Demand Management Districts, with bus and shuttle service playing a leading role, in order to promote Transit Oriented Development to feed into the nodes of mass transit that anchor such sites.  As a way of promoting additional bus service and specifically service after current hours and on the weekend, the county should look to partner with private entities as a way of providing an additional means of subsidizing such service.  This could in turn be a way of addressing adequacy issues that are faced by projects as they move through entitlements and as a way of providing transit service to those who live and work in those developments.

The first is the opportunity cost, both at a staff level and at an operations level, of supporting more sustainable modes of transportation such as shoring up WMATA service, expanding MARC service and bus service.  Second, is my aversion to building additional road capacity that would not be available to large segments of the driving public and would instead only serve to invite additional congestion.  Studies have shown that building additional capacity on existing roads does not alleviate congestion and instead soon gets filled with additional cars in short order.  In addition, toll lanes are referred to as Lexus Lanes for a reason, the price that is affixed to their use typically makes them unaffordable for the driving public at large while only providing minimal relief from congestion on the non tolled lanes.

This could take the form of a housing trust with a dedicated form of revenue, the development and deployment of inclusionary zoning, or other policy initiatives that experts in the field have reviewed and determined that they could provide benefit in the county and address this pressing issue.  While not addressing the core issues of foreclosures, I do believe that the county must examine the development of a land bank; an entity that could negotiate the purchase of bank owned properties, work with non profit actors to rehabilitate those properties and sell them to families in order to get someone living there who cares for the property.  This would not only improve the condition of these properties but also provide housing for those interested in moving to the county."

      "response": "It is important to note that while the draft zoning ordinance rewrite includes a version of this as of now, the decision rendered by the highest court in Maryland constrained the process by not allowing the District Council to render decisions on first impression, but to instead serve as an appellate body as envisioned under current law. Therefore, under this standard, the District Court can only alter decisions of the Planning Board if a decision is found to be unsupported by the facts on the record.  This is a far cry from prior actions of the District Council that could, and often would, effectively rewrite decisions of the Planning Board which would often serve as an impediment to those seeking certainty in our zoning ordinance and a disincentive to investing in the county.  While I would prefer that the rules of the game be established in the zoning ordinance, providing that level of certainty to those willing to invest in the county (while at the same time promoting development in those areas where we want it; our existing communities and at our modes of mass transit), if the District Council does decide to include call up, in whatever form, in the zoning ordinance, because of that court decision, the practice will be much more constrained than what existed in the past."

      "response": "Step number one is to preserve existing affordable housing, particularly in older buildings with larger, multibedroom units suitable for families. Especially around Purple Line stations in the eastern part of the county, homes that are currently subdivided into apartments may be bought for consolidation and elimination of affordable apartments. And buildings with subsidized units will exit the programs that financed them, which could lead to steep rent increases.   Step number two is creation of new housing, and conversion of suitable existing buildings, as housing affordable to households far before AMI.  As a Takoma Park City Council member, I worked with entities including DHCA, Montgomery Housing Partnership, and Victory Housing to create and preserve subsidized housing, and have a post-council advocacy record here. See, for instance, my article Affordable Housing Opportunity: Takoma Park's Washington McLaughlin Property (http://takomavoice.com/2017/05/11/affordablehousing-opportunity-takoma-parks-washington-mclaughlin-property/).

They may not know what is happening until the process is well under way, and decisions have already been made. The process itself may discourage participation and not take the desires of these and other groups into consideration.  A number of things can be done to increase participation. Do a better job of getting the word out. Not everyone has Internet, so leafletting in neighborhoods, engaging people on the street, signs, etc., are necessary. We can probably come up with more ways. Use engagement methods other than formal hearings, for instance charrettes. These can include less formal meetings in the neighborhoods and engaging via community groups, which can be a great way to connect. Understand cultural differences; not every group wants the same thing. Provide transportation to meetings. Provide child care at meetings. Make meetings more fun and less formal, with refreshments and social interaction. Have informational education sessions to acquaint citizens with the process and how to engage."

      "response": "Yes, I support permanent, dedicated funding streams for metro because of its critical importance to our region's future. Furthermore, I support the legislation led by Senator Feldman and Del. Mark Korman to give Metro the $167 million it needs from existing motor vehicle taxes from the state's transportation fund. I support their approach over suggestions from Governor Hogan and others that Montgomery county raise dedicated county taxes to pay for Metro. Montgomery County taxpayers are already paying for transportation improvements in other parts of the state, and it would be unfair and unwise to not apply the same principle to state funding for Metro.      As Montgomery County's Assistant Chief Administrative Officer for Economic and Workforce Development, I know that if we are to compete for talent and jobs of the future, a reliable public transit system is a must. As we have seen from Marriott's recent relocation decision and Amazon's HQ2 search criteria, talent and connectivity are the most important criteria for our competitiveness, and Metro gives our region a strong leg up. Millennials, like my son, want to live in places where they can take public transit and not have to rely on driving everywhere.      As GGWash has consistently highlighted, Metro is the only major transit system in the country without a dedicated funding source. That lack of funding jeopardizes the future of Metro due to a lack of resources to maintain the system adequately.      While admittedly, Metro has suffered from major funding deficits, I don't believe a blank check of $167 million will be sufficient without operational changes. Metro in recent years has not performed to the standards that we as a region expect and it continues to this day to have major problems like derailments, shoddily performed maintenance, and major service cutbacks that reduces the practicality of the service in off-peak hours. I applaud WMATA CEO Paul Wederfeld's “rush-hour promise” and his overall leadership in enahcning safety, reliability and fiscal management.      Some reforms proposed such as strengthening WMATA's Inspector general are a good start. However, the proposed limits on labor will only serve to undermine the power of unions and will not solve the problem that Metro does have. Since the users of Metro are customers of Metro, I would advocate a sort of performance contract with Metro, in which Maryland would continue to provide the $167 million yearly as long as Metro meets certain performance benchmarks related to service frequency and availability, on time performance, customer service satisfaction and safety."

With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "One of the biggest transportation challenges facing my district is long commute times due to explosive population growth in the Upcounty area, which is now home to ⅓ of county populations. The congestion on I-270 and the Beltway, as well as a lack of adequate public transit options has led to unbearably long commute times that reduce the quality of life and make an area less attractive for future residents and employers, forestalling a sustainable tax base.      I don't believe pitting roads against transit or choosing one mode to prioritize investment is a productive way to solve this problem. We need an “all of the above” solution that provides robust public transportation options; ensures the traffic flow on our highways, and implements transportation demand management solutions to reduce the need to commute in the first place.      That said, widening highways by providing more lane capacity has shown not to decrease congestion in the long term because of the induced demand effect. Proposals for transit and transportation demand management investments in Maryland (such as those for MARC and Metro expansion) have shown these options to be considerably less costly for the state, and would also better serve to mitigate congestion on existing roads than a widen-and-toll strategy. I also support Montgomery County's DOT's proposal to use two reversible lanes on I-270 during morning and afternoon rush hours to mitigate congestion.      Virginia uses a data-driven approach to transportation investments through their Smart Scale dashboard that rate projects according to how much benefit each project provides across several categories. This method gives the state a good idea of the benefit cost/ratio of a certain project. In order to maximize limited transportation dollars, I would advocate Maryland adopt a similar system that would look at how transportation projects compare in reducing congestion, protecting our environment and increasing transportation equity in our community. The projects that score best on these metrics should be the ones funded."

Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "I grew up in Shanghai where biking, walking and public transit was the way of life and still is what makes the city run. I support greater investments by the State Highway Administration in non-motorized modes of transportation like walking, bicycling and transit so that all residents regardless of where they live have a choice of transportation mode they take, including driving. In particular, we as a state can do a lot better job providing safer biking and walking options to schools, and I support a review by the State Highway Administration of the engineering of the roads and pedestrian crossings at every school in order to make sure they are safe for our kids.      Too many people walking and bicycling have been killed recently. No one should have to worry about not returning from the transportation trip they take. As a supporter of Complete Streets, I think that the State Highway Administration should do a better job on neighborhood and local streets balancing the needs of pedestrians and cyclists versus drivers, while keeping the road concept in mind. Local streets, cul-de-sacs, and urban neighborhoods should ensure that car traffic is at an appropriate speed in order to maintain the safety of the community; street design in these areas should not encourage speeding cars.     For major arterials and thoroughfares, I think we should look at all options to make roads safer for all users, including drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. However, unlike neighborhood streets, these thoroughfares serve an important role in moving people in cars to important destinations like jobs. Re-engineering these roads and surrounding ones to limit motorist interaction with non-motorists could increase safety while allowing people to get where they need to be at a reasonable speed.  "

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Transit alone can catalyze all sorts of development in an area. Good governance around transit should seek to to maximize the economic returns on transit investments by aligning land use, housing, and economic development policies with those investments. At the state level, Maryland has historically been aggressive about promoting TOD, including allowing eligibility for the Transportation Trust Fund, and through partnerships between MDOT and MDP.     However, we also need to ensure that the development spurred by transit supports those who stand most to benefit: the households that are most transit-reliant, that may have limited mobility options, and that may live long distances from where they work. Low-income households have the potential to become even more vulnerable when any capital investment, including transit, is made without considerations to equity.      I would support including equity considerations in the state-level planning and implementation programs for TOD financing, and explicit programmatic linkages between transit/TOD and the Maryland DHCD and the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust. Additionally, MDOT's joint development program should include criteria prioritizing proposals that not only include good mixed-use development, but partner with affordable housing developers, or otherwise consider how community amenities can be accessed by existing businesses and residents.

      "question": "Our region shares many things: a transit system, a housing market, even a football team. Would you like to see Maryland, Virginia, and DC collaborate to avoid a race to the bottom? How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Good economic stewardship in the DMV region needs to prioritize putting the entire region on a trajectory of higher growth. This means cooperation among regions to not only prevent large-scale bidding wars and a “race to the bottom,” but also to collaborate on the region's most critical issues. A great starting point would be Metro, which has become a symbol of the region's lack of collaboration. As previously mentioned, I support dedicated funding for Metro, and would be very excited to see parallel 1% sales taxes across Metro's jurisdictions to support the system.     That said, it is an economic imperative for Maryland and Montgomery County to be regionally competitive, although there are ways to do that without crafting lucrative money deals or undermining regional success. A priority of my career in Montgomery County has been to ameliorate the County of its reputation of business unfriendliness, and help provide access to jobs near homes that match our residents' diverse educational backgrounds and career aspirations. In the case of Amazon, strategizing around a bid has allowed us to push ourselves to accelerate progress on things that were already core economic development priorities—such as increasing multimodal transportation funding, focusing on walkable neighborhood development, and investing in our communities and businesses.     Ultimately, Maryland doesn't need to be the one offering tax breaks to share in the benefits. Amazon locating anywhere in the region will benefit all jurisdictions, and inevitably some of the new employees will be Maryland residents.  I celebrate any win for the region no matter which side of the river it is, but a strong, competitive Montgomery County and Maryland is good for Virginia, DC and the region as a whole and we in Montgomery County need more corporate and regional headquarters as we highlighted in our comprehensive economic strategy."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "Transit must be our highest priority if we are going to maximize our ability to grow our County with livable, walkable communities that will attract businesses and residents alike. More companies and people realize the benefit of living near transit hubs. Not only does it make their commutes more convenient and affordable, but transit-oriented communities typically have many amenities that add to a high quality of life. Also, transit is crucial for those who struggle economically. The ability to get to work in a comfortable, affordable way promotes economic fairness.  I do not support M-83. I do not believe the Governor's proposal to widen the beltway is practical but look forward to seeing the results of his proposal for I-270 and the American Legion Bridge. I feel that reversible lanes on 270 would be preferable to widening."

      "response": "Whenever county-owned property becomes available for redevelopment, its proposed uses should be thoroughly vetted with stakeholders in the community where it's located while also considering the priorities of the entire county. I commend County Executive Ike Leggett for having done precisely this with the reuse of the old Silver Spring library.  Many voices weighed in and he considered the greatest good the property could fulfil. The result is a solution provides not only much needed affordable child care at the library site, but affordable senior housing in Viva White Oak on a site that will shortly become a transit-accessible hub on the Route 29 BRT.      The Victory senior housing will accommodate more housing units at the White Oak site than at the library site, and can be constructed sooner. I believe in leadership that strives not to divide our residents, but seeks to address the concerns of all stakeholders. In this case the solution effectively fulfills two of our highest priorities, affordable child care and affordable senior housing."

      "response": "As a business owner, I'm trained to think at least 15-20 years out and to focus on what is best for the long-term good of our community. That is why I believe that the federal government needs to work with local and state governments to create a long-term strategy to fully fund Metro's maintenance and operations. Given Metro's importance to our region, and the federal workforce in particular, the federal government must play a significant role in any long-term funding agreement.     Metro has immediate governance issues that need to be addressed, but I believe the most pressing issues it faces are severe underfunding and outdated equipment that have led to recent declines in reliability and ridership. So I support increased funding to improve maintenance and reliability, even as we reform Metro's board and address other pressing governance issues.     These are investments we can't afford NOT to make. According to Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld, the rail system needs at least $500 million in capital funding. This is an urgent priority for our region and the federal government has a responsibility to do its part."

President Trump recently proposed cutting several grant programs that are administered by the Federal Transit Administration. These programs are important and help fund local transit projects.     The budget cuts would reduce the Passenger Rail and Investment and Improvement Act, a program that helps fund Metro, by $30 million.

      "response": "Funding for infrastructure improvements is a shared responsibility of local, state and federal governments and each has a variety of funding mechanisms available, but the bottom line is we are not investing enough in transportation in this region and need to do more. At the federal level, I support Congressman John Delaney's plan to fund more infrastructure projects by creating an Infrastructure Bank.     The Infrastructure Bank would be funded using a mixture of repatriated corporate earnings and public-private partnerships creating the American Infrastructure Fund (AIF). This fund would then assist state and local governments with loans.     We should also look at other sources of funding like closing the carried interest loophole that allows hedge fund partners to pay a lower tax rate on their profits than working Americans pay on their income taxes.

      "response": "Land-use issues like this are primarily the responsibility of County and municipal governments and planning agencies. The federal government plays a very minor role, so opportunities for any member of Congress to influence where new jobs and housing are placed in any of the five counties that make up Maryland's 6th Congressional District are extremely limited.     That said, to the extent that federal policies, programs and investment decisions can help influence those local government decisions, I believe we should continue to focus future jobs and housing in those areas where we already have town centers, transit services, walkable communities, and other public infrastructure in place and preserve valuable open space for future generations.     Growing up on a farm, I understand the importance of agriculture, in particular, and that the needs in Garrett County are entirely different from those in Montgomery or Frederick counties.     I believe we all have a responsibility to protect the rural character of much of the 6th District, even while we attract more good jobs, revitalize our small towns and urban centers, a provide a wide variety of safe and healthy living environments for all of our residents. I will be happy to work with local government leaders in all five counties, wherever possible, to help achieve these goals to the degree which Congress plays any role."

If I'm elected County Executive, I would hope to see BRT in service on Route 29, Veirs Mill Road and Route 355 by the end of my second term, and I would support planning for other routes as well. Dedicated lanes are optimal and will, I hope, be utilized on all three, although the Route 29 proposal currently calls for bus travel in mixed traffic through Four Corners.

      "response": "Yes. The best way to increase the affordable housing stock is to build more housing. I have consistently been willing to support affordable housing, even when adjacent neighbors raised objections. No other councilmember running for Executive can make the same claim.  If elected County Executive, I will prioritize increases to the Housing Initiative Fund (HIF) each year, along with expanded county housing vouchers for low-income county residents. My goal would be that we fund the HIF by at least $100 million in my first term as County Executive.  When Ike Leggett was elected to his first term as County Executive, I suggested to him that he create the position of Faith Liaison, which both Fairfax County and the District of Columbia had already. The position is currently filled by the Rev. Mansfield \"Kasey\" Kaseman. If I'm elected County Executive, I will significantly increase the portfolio of that position. Kasey has been working to develop a GIS mapping system of houses of worship, which I would like to see us put to use to identify locations where affordable housing could be developed. Then, we should work to partner willing houses of worship with developers to utilize available land for a multiplicity of affordable housing types, ranging from multi-family buildings to collections of tiny homes. Religious institutions are mission-driven, and many of them have land that could be made available at a below-market price.   I will make sure the county's Department of Housing and Community Affairs is headed by a creative thinker with a personal passion for affordable housing, who keeps abreast of innovations in other state and local governments, and who reads widely in industry, academic and advocacy publications in the housing field. I will set a clear expectation that I want that individual, and all my department heads, frequently to explore and bring me new ideas for effective, inclusive and progressive approaches to our county's major challenges, among which affordable housing is a top priority for me. We must never get too satisfied in thinking that Montgomery County knows the best approaches already. The Chief of Special Needs Housing in the Department of Health and Human Services is another key position that I will fill with great care. I will also seek creativity, energy and a passion for affordable housing from my appointees to the Housing Opportunities Commission.  In December, I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. My dissertation topic, \"The Stubborn Persistence of Homelessness,\" discusses the challenges communities face in ending chronic and veterans' homelessness. Among these are the difficulty in measuring whether that outcome is being achieved. My dissertation specifically seeks to assess whether the 100,000 Homes Campaign, which enlisted 186 communities across America (including Montgomery County, Maryland), between 2010 and 2014, had a statistically significant effect on reducing chronic homelessness. The dissertation finds that it did not, although it had positive effects by helping communities better understand the inflow of persons into chronic homelessness, and by establishing evidence-based practices for reducing chronic homelessness.  The best source of good ideas regarding the expansion of affordable housing currently available, in my opinion, is the Rental Housing Study recently commissioned by Park and Planning: http://montgomeryplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RHS_Strategy-Document.pdf.  As a member of the County Council's Planning, Housing and Economic Development Committee, I am looking forward to participating actively in the committee's discussion of the study. It contains a rich menu of recommendations, all of which merit in-depth discussion. I like the suggestions for added flexibility in imposition of MPDU requirements, including variability by FAR to encourage larger below-market rental apartments. I agree that we should strengthen requirements for affordable housing on public land. I think there are areas of the county that can sustain a 15% MPDU requirement, and will carefully consider the study's recommendations regarding phasing in of this requirement, and associated density bonuses. I like the idea of reducing parking requirements to enable more affordable housing adjacent to transit stations. I am open to discussion of the study's recommendations for required payments to the Housing Initiative Fund by subdivisions under 20 units, and for a demolition tax.  Beyond the rich menu of recommendations in the rental housing study, I would like to see us revisit, and provide even greater flexibility for, the approval of accessory apartments and other shared housing arrangements. I'd also support strengthening the requirement that all public land must be reviewed for the feasibility of affordable housing development before it is repurposed in any way, and auditing all county property, including parking garages, to assess the feasibility of affordable housing development. I'd like to explore whether land could be rezoned to permit the establishment of Community Land Trusts and clusters of tiny homes.  At the end of my service as County Executive, I'd like to see not only that there was no net loss of affordable housing, but that we substantially increased the number of affordable units in our county."

The current need for affordable housing in Montgomery County is approximately 50,000 units. The reason for this shortfall is in part because the county's moderately priced dwelling units (MDPU) are no longer keeping up with demand, largely because many new housing units are in high rise condominiums – structures where an individual apartment might be affordable but the condo fee isn't.

Forty years ago Montgomery County became a national leader by devising the MPDU program. Today, we need to regain our place as a national leader by modernizing our housing policy. Let's bring together the best and brightest to create a modern housing policy that works for individuals across the economic spectrum."

      "response": "In my capacity as vice chair of Montgomery Housing Partnership, I am proud that in 2016 we built The Bonifant in downtown Silver Spring, which provides 149 units for seniors age 62 and older.     I support the Silver Spring Library being redeveloped into a multi-use building that provides affordable housing for seniors and includes a child care facility. The need for each of these functions is great and this is an exciting opportunity to provide services for the oldest and youngest in our community."

One way to encourage more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions is by facilitating meetings at different times and in different locations, thereby allowing individuals with non-conventional work schedules to participate.     We should be proactively going directly to communities that will be affected by these important decisions.

      "question": "Are you committed to implementation of Vision Zero (zero traffic deaths)? What is the most important change to the roadways, law, or DOT practices that could bring about Vision Zero?",
      "response": "Yes, I am very interested in any plan that will reduce and/or eliminate traffic deaths.  Vision Zero certainly is taking the lead on this.  From my standpoint, the most important change to the roadways that could bring about Vision Zero is keeping safety in mind first and foremost when designing our streets and intersections.         For example, some of the intersections in Montgomery County are downright dangerous because they are confusing.  One such confusion intersection is located on the I-270 overpass at Maryland 189.  This confusing pasta-like entanglement not only features confusing ramps leading to and from I-270, it also features copious amounts of broken plastic and bits of metal from the numerous crashes that take place here.  This makes it not only a confusingly dangerous place for cars, it makes it extremely dangerous for motorcycles, and a near death trap for bicyclists and pedestrians.  The fact that it is located very close to Julius West Middle School makes addressing this intersection even more important.  A redesign of it using the Vision Zero methodology would be most welcome.           Another good example of a confusing muddle of signage, oddly colored street markings, and an absolutely unique street set up is what is currently in place in downtown Silver Spring on Spring Street between the Park and Planning Headquarters on Georgia Avenue up to the area near the Civic Center on Ellsworth Drive.  This recently added IQ/agility test is a Kafka-esque befuddlement of bike lanes that sometimes abut sidewalks, and other times crisscross a lane of traffic.  Lane markings in an unusual shade of purple never described in any driver's manual appear in unusual places.  And miniature pylons routinely get trimmed by trucks trying to figure this maze out.  While well intended, someone is bound to get hurt by all this confusing jumble of traffic humanity.         Vision Zero should address situations like these.  The design of all roadways should be straightforward and as simple and easy to understand as possible.  And I know, as your next At-Large Councilmember, my staff and I will be closely watching the success of this initiative and expect great things from it."

      "question": "Montgomery County has many proposed transportation projects, including a county-wide Bus Rapid Transit network, the Corridor Cities Transitway, MARC expansion, widening of I-495 and I-270, Midcounty Highway (M-83), Montrose Parkway East, and more. With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "     We must take a global view of all these projects.  The Department of Transportation, County Executive, County Council, and all interested parties should convene a Transit and Infrastructure Forum II, similar to the one hosted by Roger Berliner a few years ago, specifically to go over each proposal, the total cost for each project, projected timeline, and ultimate number of users of each project on a daily basis.  With these numbers, a metric could be developed to figure out where we can receive the biggest return on investment.           Some of these projects, Montrose Parkway East in particular, have already met opposition.  Councilmember Marc Elrich has already gone on the record for opposing this project.  And he makes a good point.  While it is true the road will help reduce traffic on Randolph Road, it will only move vehicular traffic about a half mile further north on Veirs Mill Road.  More questionable still is the fact a large portion of this road goes through or near a park.  Is it worth destroying that many trees simply to save people a couple of minutes of travel time?  Establishing a metric for items such as this would enable us to better examine the true cost of these projects.         I am in favor of getting many parties at the table because, as much as possible, we need to solicit community input on these projects.  And we also need to be realistic about which projects are truly worth the investment based on the limited financial resources available.  My hope would be that at the end of the process all parties involved would walk away satisfied, or at least understanding the final results, with the prioritization because it took a fair and formulaic approach to all projects.

Yes, as long as our zoning experts agree that we can find more efficient ways to speed up the approval process without sacrificing safety.  Can this be done?  Most likely.           I think it is not practical right now to allocate less parking for multifamily housing – be it near Metro, the Purple Line, MARC or BRT.  That said, we may be able to reduce minimum parking requirements in the future if we make a major commitment as a county to shift away from using cars and decide to invest greater resources in improving our mass transit options (such as adding WiFi and USB/charging ports to our buses, making seating more comfortable, adding screens to display estimated travel time to stations along with county information, and more.

      "question": "The county's recent Rental Housing Study noted that 38% of the rental housing demand is from households below 50% AMI, but only 19% of housing is affordable at that level. How would you like to see the county close this gap?",
      "response": "This is an ongoing issue in Montgomery County.  Currently we dedicate 12.5% of all new housing to being affordable.  There is talk to increase this from anywhere from 15% to 25%.  However, we need to be cognizant of the fact if we place unrealistic burdens on the companies investing in these projects, they may choose to forgo building here and build elsewhere.  This could cause a major challenge by further limiting housing stock as we grow the economy with our existing businesses, and welcome new businesses such as the Amazon 2 headquarters, and other companies here.         One manner in which to address the affordable housing issue is to work with organizations such as Montgomery Housing Partnership to redevelop properties that have fallen on hard times.  They currently have 1,700 units and provide wrap around services for the entire family.  Individual programs like these can fill the need of some households by providing affordable housing, along with after school enrichment for students, and computer and job training for adults.           As for expanding the percentage of affordable housing, it seems wise for us to partner up with those constructing new units, as well as those with existing buildings, to come up with a program that provides an added benefit in the form of tax incentives along with quality of life benefits if they extend the amount of affordable housing made available to 15% or beyond specifically geared toward teachers, police, firefighters, nurses, and other first responders.  The value added of having these selfless professionals in a building is tremendous.  Aside from the general safety benefits, you also are doing them a tremendous favor.  Many of our community heroes live in other counties.  If we can encourage them to live here, it provides us with a much greater benefit – happier folks because they have less travel time to and from work.  They can also become more active in the community in which they work.             Also worth exploring are some of the creative communities being established elsewhere in the country such as reasonably priced housing dedicated specifically for newer teachers.  These communities also provide college like campuses that enable residents, many of whom have shared interests, to collaborate with much greater ease than is normally possible."

The renaissance of the downtown area simply begs for some affordable housing to be built on the site.  Would also like the community to consider expanding the scope of this project beyond the suggested four stories and ninety-two units.  This property is simply too valuable and readily accessible to the Civic Center and downtown Silver Spring to not try to open it up to even more seniors who would greatly benefit from the close proximity to such wonderful cultural offerings, shopping, dining and transportation options.         My general approach to new development and redevelopment projects is to provide the maximum benefit of a property's proximity to mass transportation, cultural offerings, shopping, schools, and more.  Thus, the closer a property is situated to such conveniences, the more units we should consider building there…of course within reason and traffic considerations.   "

      "question": "Many Montgomery County candidates say they want to see more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions. Whose voices do you think are under-represented now, and why? What would you do to help those voices be heard?",
      "response": "A large percentage of our population is underrepresented now in land use and transportation decisions.  There is no doubt about it.  Why?  Because many people are too busy working, trying to eke out a living, and spend what limited free time they may have with family and friends.  This absolutely affects those of more modest means, those for whom English is not their primary language, and folks who are not in the loop when it comes to keeping in tune with what is going on in their community due to a variety of factors.         We live in a representative democracy.  We choose to elect officials to do their best to represent our opinions on issues that effect us.  Do they always hit the mark?  No.  However having worked extensively as Immediate Past President of the Montgomery County of Parent-Teacher Associations (MCCPTA) with our 42,000+ members, as well as many members of our community, and elected officials at many levels, I can tell you, our elected officials do listen.           As MCCPTA President, and for three years before that as a member of their eight member Executive Committee, I did my best to reach out to our members all across the county to solicit their input on all aspects of the school system.  Eventually this branched out into work with an MCCPTA subgroup we formed called the Next Steps Reps that discussed the Subdivision Staging Policy with the Planning Commission, Board of Education, County Council and community.  This was necessary because school construction projects were hopelessly backlogged and underfunded, and too many of our schools were overcrowded and suffered from limited core space (hallways, cafeterias, gyms, libraries) accommodating more students than were originally imagined for each building.  Like many projects I worked on, I took the suggestions of my members, some of whom were from schools that felt they were not listened to in the past, and made their opinions known.  We had tremendous success and were able to help convince the County Council to do the right thing and provide more funding to school construction projects.         The voices I have done my best to represent over the years, aside from our 161,546 students, 23,200 teachers, staff, and administrators, PTA members, and neighbors countywide are those of the under represented in our community.  As one of the few people running for an At-Large seat on the County Council with experience as a countywide elected leader with a significant track record of major accomplishments, one of my hallmarks has been advocating for projects that benefit all residents of Montgomery County…particularly those that may have traditionally fallen through the cracks.  One example is Summit Hall Elementary School.  This gem of a Gaithersburg school was seemingly forgotten about by many.  My friend and fellow At-Large candidate Melissa McKenna and I worked with their outstanding Principal, Keith Jones, and incomparable PTA President, Oscar Alvarenga, to make sure the school received a new HVAC system they desperately needed as well as two large classroom additions called modules (eight classrooms per module) built adjacent to the building to replace old, decrepit portables structures, some of which were there for more than twenty years.           Another example of an underrepresented community was the Carl Sandburg Learning Center.  This school serves less than one hundred students who have challenges.  When I first visited the school, the most noticeable challenge was a lack of heat on a cold winter day.  This was a school Melissa first brought to my attention back in 2014.  Together we advocated to make sure the heat was fixed, and other quality of life issues the community asked us to help on were addressed.  Most notable was desperately needed replacement of broken kitchen equipment which we persisted in making sure took place.  This is the kind of teamwork we need on our nine member County Council.           Over my nearly unprecedented four years on the eight member Executive Committee of MCCPTA, we had incredible advocacy success.  The 2016 Education First Budget was something I am very proud to have played a key role in helping get passed.  Much of the reason for work such as this and my ongoing efforts to pursue a much greater share of casino gambling revenues from table games from the state are to make sure we are meeting the needs of everyone in the community…especially those who may not be traditionally heard from.  It was my hallmark from the start of my countywide PTA career, and it has only strengthened over the years.             From my first day as a Councilmember, I will pro-actively seek out my 1,040,000 constituents.  And, just as I have done for more than four and a half years, I will talk to those I meet about what they like and what stands improving in Montgomery County.  I will attend religious services and community meetings ceaselessly, just as I have done in the past.  I want people to feel I am approachable, reasonable, and will listen.  I care.  And that makes a huge difference."

I was proud to join members of Greater Greater Washington, Action Committee for Transit, Better BRT and others to testify before the Council on 2/28/18 in support of the US 29 study. BRT is a safe, cost-effective, efficient way to reduce congestion and commuting times for the residents of Montgomery County. This is especially true in the East County, which is severely underserved by transit. The expansion of Bus Rapid Transit along Route 29 is a matter of economic and environmental justice. But for BRT to deliver maximum benefit to the county, it must be fully implemented with dedicated lanes that allow buses to bypass traffic. This includes narrowing or removing general purpose lanes if and where needed."

      "response": "Yes. As someone who is rather well-known for encouraging her children to walk in downtown Silver Spring, I am committed to full implementation of Vision Zero. There is no one silver bullet policy that will accomplish that. However, there are a number of changes that could be implemented in the short-term that would help dramatically. Adding crosswalks: many busy intersections lack the required four crosswalks, forcing pedestrians to take circuitous routes or endanger themselves when crossing. In some locations, mid-block crossings may be appropriate and welcome additions. Lowering speed limits on many roads is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Eliminating the dangerous practice of allowing right turns on red. Adding brightly-painted crosswalks at every intersection and speed enforcement and tickets for drivers who endanger pedestrians.     To fully realize the goals of Vision Zero, we must reimagine and redesign our communities around people, not cars. Too often, the roads that pass through major urban areas - Georgia, Wisconsin, and Connecticut Avenues and Colesville Road - are designed to move as many cars as fast as possible, ignoring the needs and safety of the people who walk and bike in those urban districts. We must give priority to people on foot and cyclists over cars for the long-term health and safety of our communities."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "As a climate scientist, I will always prioritize transportation projects that allow us to move the greatest number of people efficiently and with low or no greenhouse gas emissions. One of my top priorities is building a comprehensive transit network, including MARC expansion, fully-funded Metro, and BRT, to connect all parts of the County to each other and to neighboring cities and counties, as described by the Maryland Transit Opportunities Coalition. Efficient transit is critical to economic development. Every dynamic city and economy on the planet depends on transit.     It is well documented that expanding roads does not alleviate congestion. Instead, it  creates induced demand, which adds to congestion problems. For this reason and other devastating environmental impacts they would have on open space, forests, streams, agricultural lands, and wetlands, I oppose M-83 and an outer-bridge crossing over the Potomac, which would mean building a new highway through the Agricultural Reserve.    However where road expansion is needed to support systems like BRT or other mass  transit, I would consider it. For example, adding reversible lanes on I-270 to support BRT might be a project I could support. Expansion of the American Legion Bridge may be advisable, if it is indeed needed to alleviate traffic at that choke point, but I would need to see more data before making that decision. That also seems like a project that would need to include a mass transit component to be successful and to have my support -- either BRT or extending commuter train service such as the Purple Line."

I know from personal experience how difficult it can be to navigate the regulatory process from our experience converting our basement into an apartment for my aging father. I support reducing the parking requirements close to Purple Line, Metro, and BRT stations, as those neighborhoods are well-designed to reduce the need for individual car ownership. The zoning changes should provide for as much affordable housing as we can achieve in transit-oriented development sectors."

      "response": "There are many reasons why Montgomery County has a stake in creating more affordable housing. It is a matter of economic and social justice. It is also crucial to the functioning of an efficient market for housing, as alluded to in the question. Affordable housing is a critical ingredient for economic growth, as we must have adequate housing to meet the needs of current and future needs of workers and entrepreneurs. We must pursue a range of strategies to encourage affordable housing throughout the County. The more options we create, the more impact we can have on the market, not only increasing the affordability of homes, but also helping to control the run-away price of housing by providing the supply needed to meet growing demand.   Where infrastructure exists to support a much greater density of affordable housing, the County should facilitate it, i.e., near existing Metro and soon-to-be Purple Line and BRT stations. Whenever the County grants permits for large development, it should be requiring at least 15% MPDUs, if not higher. We can also bring transit to areas that are already affordable, for example, by bringing BRT to the east and upcounty areas, so that residents can move to more affordable areas further out, without contributing to sprawl and traffic congestion. Given the reality that many people have located further out to find affordable housing, we do need to respond with attractive mass transit options. This will help alleviate the traffic throughout the system, but it's greatest value will be in connecting lower-income households to the central core job sectors.  I do not support rent controls, which has been found to reduce the availability of rental housing, especially for lower-income residents. However, I do support rent stabilization policies to slow the steep rise in rents. Rent stabilization has the potential to open up the market for home and apartment sales, and will relieve some of the economic pressures that are causing us to lose our diverse housing stock. I believe this will create new incentives to build apartment complexes that offer 3+ bedroom apartments suitable for families. The County government should include provisions in future plans to require building with families' needs in mind.    As I wrote in answer to question #4, we should rezone certain single-home neighborhoods to allow for more multifamily construction. This will allow us to increase the number affordable units in desirable areas without increasing the footprint of the housing. It also provides homeowners with a way of downsizing and earning income, which could be especially helpful for seniors who have paid off their mortgages and wish to age in place in their neighborhoods. Allowing for accessory dwellings to be more easily licensed and rented would be a boon to young singles and small families looking for an alternative to pricey apartment buildings.   We can leverage federal funds through Low-Income Housing tax credits, and create other incentives for developers willing to provide more units at truly affordable prices or rents."

      "response": "I strongly supported the proposal to build senior housing and a childcare facility on the site. I was disappointed to learn that plan was rejected in favor of a much more limited childcare project. The combination of childcare and senior living had the potential to create a wonderful intergenerational facility and micro-community, which has been shown to benefit children and elders alike. Silver Spring desperately needs more affordable senior housing, as evidenced by the 800+ person waiting list for newly opened The Bonifant. As the caregiver to an 80-year old parent who lives with me in downtown Silver Spring, I am committed to helping our seniors age in place, which includes living in vibrant walkable communities with easy access to amenities and transit.     The old library site is in walking distance from the Silver Spring metro and an ideal site for high density development. I am in favor of increasing density and walkability around all Metro stations, including the poorly-planned and under-developed areas around Forest Glen and Glenmont. Transit-oriented development, combined with planning to increase walk- and bike-ability, is critical for Montgomery County's economy and for the health and well being of residents. Extensive research confirms the recent Washington Post headline: “walkable neighborhoods provide health, environmental, and financial benefits.”     As we promote greater housing density in TOD sectors, it is incumbent on government to do the planning that will support the growth of neighborhoods. We must support a full-range of the services that residents there will need, and provide more options for the very populations that will most benefit from living in vital neighborhoods that cater to most of their needs.     Montgomery County is changing. That is painful for some older residents and I am sympathetic to their discomfort. At the same time, we have a moral obligation to build a future that works for all of our residents and reflects the changing needs of our population. This includes walkability and transit-access, which is critical for people who cannot or choose not to own a car, including many seniors, low-income residents, immigrants, and millennials."

General outreach across the county about climate and affordable housing goals and the Master Plan will help more county residents to understand the larger goals and to be more amenable to change when it is proposed for their communities.    However, it is important to note that, while the voices protesting development are often the loudest, they rarely reflect the diversity of County residents, especially those who would benefit from proposed changes. While Montgomery County is majority-minority, and one out of every three residents has settled here from another county, the majority of hearings and meetings that I have attended are dominated by white, affluent, older residents. While these individuals deserve to be heard, we must be careful not to allow their voices to drown out the real concerns in the silence of those who cannot attend meetings because of conflicts with work or child care schedules or who do not show up because they are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the limited, often confusing mechanisms available for registering their opinions. The silent majority in the county is often younger, non-white, less affluent, and more transit-dependent. Many are in greater need of affordable housing, public schools, and access to jobs -- in other words, more in need of the increase in services and economic growth that development can provide.     We must develop ways for these additional, distinct voices to be heard. A few simple changes would be to allow remote or recorded video or audio testimony at hearings, so that people do not have to be able to dedicate an entire evening and a trip to Rockville to be heard. Official hearings can be held in multiple places and times for important or controversial decisions, to allow for greater input. And County members and other decision-makers need to do outreach in the places and institutions where residents gather, including schools, houses of worship in culturally-appropriate ways. Bringing now disenfranchised community members into the conversation will require education and will take effort, funding, and time and must be prioritized by the next Council.  "

      "response": "Yes, I support BRT along U.S. 29. The County Executive and Council have funded an approach to get BRT moving on U.S. 29 by designating dedicated lanes. I would like to see the service quickly implemented with the opportunity to continue to enhance BRT south of White Oak as redevelopment and changing ridership demand.

      "question": "Montgomery County has many proposed transportation projects, including a county-wide Bus Rapid Transit network, the Corridor Cities Transitway, MARC expansion, widening of I-495 and I-270, Midcounty Highway (M-83), Montrose Parkway East, and more. With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "My overriding concern with transportation planning is that we work to create a transportation system that gives commuters a reliable system of alternatives to driving.     Given this, I would prioritize transit projects over projects that would create additional road infrastructure.     We need an enhanced bus service that works for more people by providing frequent and reliable service. I strongly support BRT, including the 355 BRT that is currently in development, and I also support the CCT.    I support a significant expansion of the MARC train schedule.    When it comes to new road construction, I believe that we need targeted improvements, and we need to tie any new highway construction to transit options wherever feasible.     As for widening I-270 or the Beltway, I oppose extensive construction that would cause unacceptable environmental and property impacts and promote sprawl development.    The M83 highway has been in Montgomery County's Master Plan of Highways for decades, but given its enormous fiscal and environmental costs, I believe the County would be far better served by examining possible transit alternatives and capacity improvements along existing roads for Clarksburg."

      "response": "Everyone deserves an affordable, decent home – whether they own or rent.    Communities with affordable housing have diverse populations — elderly and young, high-income and low-income, in a full range of occupations and from the spectrum of ethnic and racial groups. This variety contributes to community vitality and enhances the quality of life for every resident. And an array of housing options means residents can remain in the community as they age and as their financial circumstances change.    To encourage developers to meet the needs for affordable housing, the County should increase funding for the Housing Initiative Fund. The Council should work with our state delegation and the state to make sure that the County gets its fair share of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). I would welcome innovative approaches.     It's also important to note that early versions of the GOP tax bill would have eliminated the federal tax exemption for private activity bonds, long a source of federal subsidy to encourage private developers to construct affordable housing (and hospitals, bridges, and schools), in addition to lowering the cap for deductible mortgage interest. As a tax lawyer with some background in municipal bonds, I would help the Council be a watchdog on these types of federal efforts."

      "response": "I agree with the County's decision to use the former library site for an early childhood education and development center.     Affordable, high-quality childcare and education is essential to enable parents to get and keep a job and to give children a strong start toward success in school and life. Early care and education is a critical part of the solution. Achievement differences start early, and children who enter kindergarten behind their peers may never catch up. It's also fundamental to the economic security of women and families and central to the economic health of our County.     The MBGCDC/CentroNia proposal also seems best suited to the surrounding residential neighborhoods, would result in more green space than the Spring House/Victory House proposal, and is financially more advantageous to the County.     I am very concerned about the lack of affordable housing in general, and the need for senior housing particularly. I welcome all approaches to fill these needs."

      "response": "Yes. Dedicated lanes are central to the “rapid” in Bus Rapid Transit. Especially on a road as congested as Rt. 29 is heading into downtown Silver Spring, dedicated lanes are essential to making sure that the BRT is a truly efficient transportation option for East County residents. Having a swift-moving transit option will also create a huge incentive for people to get out of their cars and onto BRT, thereby also reducing congestion for those who do need to drive."

      "response": "This statement says everything about why I support Vision Zero: “Human life takes priority over mobility and other objectives of the road system.” This clear and obvious priority must drive our approach to all roadway planning and implementation. I'm excited that Montgomery County is setting an example of leadership for other counties in the nation, not just with Vision Zero but also with the Pedestrian Safety Initiative.    The Vision Zero 2-Year Action Plan includes an critical statistic that is easy to overlook in the wealth of data: 53% of pedestrian fatalities and 50% of cyclist fatalities occur when these users are illegally in the roadway. What that tells me right away is that pedestrians and cyclists don't have enough of the infrastructure they need to move around effectively while staying safe. I also live just off of the segment of University Boulevard W that has the highest number of collisions on a state-maintained road in the county, and my family's experience on this roadway bears out this conclusion: we have extremely narrow sidewalks, no bike lanes, and a dearth of signal crosswalks at important places where pedestrians and cyclists need to cross the street - such as at Wheaton Forest Park, a heavily used neighborhood recreation space on University Blvd W where the nearest crosswalk is blocks away.    We must invest in better walking and biking infrastructure. Adding more crosswalks on University would require drivers to slow down and stop much more - but that's a good thing, because speed is a key factor in whether or not a pedestrian survives a crash. We need to build infrastructure that clearly signals to drivers and all roadway users that we must share the road with one another, and that forces us to pay attention and respect one another's lives."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",

That's why full implementation of all currently proposed Bus Rapid Transit corridors (Rts. 29, 355, 586) and the Corridor Cities Transitway are two of my top transit priorities. These projects will expand and improve transportation options in grossly underserved areas of our county - White Oak, Burtonsville, Gaithersburg, Germantown, and Clarksburg - where existing and planned development needs to be properly supported with infrastructure. BRT projects are highly cost-effective ways to provide public transit in a relatively quick timeframe. Additionally, the areas of the county that will be served by these projects are the same areas that more broadly face environmental, economic and social injustice - so prioritizing these projects is also prioritizing meeting the needs of our most vulnerable community members."

However, it must be paired with ongoing community-centered planning for the areas around transit stations, to ensure that transit improvements benefit existing residents and businesses as well as those who will come in the future. We must preserve existing and develop new affordable housing and commercial space, and we need to preserve and expand essential community spaces and green spaces in near transit stations.

Relying primarily on large developers and large projects is creating unsustainable and unmanageable impacts on our community infrastructure (from roads to schools) - yet still not producing the number of units we need to address the housing crisis in our community. I want our housing production strategies to include:    * Increasing in the percentage of affordable housing required by the MPDU program, as well as extend the affordability periods for both rental and sale units.  * Protecting existing affordable housing units through rent stabilization, preventing rent hikes on existing tenants as a neighborhood's amenities improve.  * Prioritizing infill mid-rise residential and commercial development over high-rise development, with better incentives and support for infill and mid-rise developers who commit to deep levels of affordability in their developments.  * Changing our zoning so that homeowners can increase housing density on their lots when appropriate, through accessory dwelling units and through allowing buildings to be subdivided."

The Victory Housing proposal meets critical needs for our county: housing for seniors who face ongoing challenges with finding housing on fixed incomes, and children and their parents who need more child care options in the community. (We also need to invest in child care affordability for parents with low and moderate incomes.) It is important that we continue improving the quality and availability of green space in downtown Silver Spring.

I want to create issue working groups so that community members can connect with me and my staff in order to determine and implement our shared policy priorities for the county. I want to train and develop community organizers on my team who can establish and maintain relationships with residents and leaders in our communities. And I want to ensure that community members are empowered to play an active role as advocates and ambassadors who are setting and implementing public policy. A good example of strong engagement with underrepresented communities is the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission's environmental stormwater management program.  They hired immigrant community members to work in outreach, directly contacting residents, informing them about the process, and seeking their participation in the river clean-up programs."

In order to provide more desperately needed affordable housing below that level, DHCA currently acquires MPDUs and buys them down as a way to subsidize them in order to produce available units below 50% AMI. This is an approach that should be reinforced, but requires more funding. Given the magnitude of our affordable housing crisis, we need an all-in approach – a comprehensive solution to a comprehensive problem which must include both below market-rate and market-rate options, incentivizes for the private-sector and direct investment from the public sector. That means greater investments and prioritization to increase funding to the HIF, establishing a countywide MPDU standard of 15% for all new construction, and an overall increase in supply because the luxury units of twenty and thirty years ago are the market-rate affordable of today."

I am particularly disappointed that we now will neither have an attractive affordable senior housing facility in a vibrant area to help our seniors live with vitality, dignity, and mobility nor an attractive park in downtown Silver Spring. We need both affordable senior housing and public open spaces in our urban areas, and we've now we've lost the opportunity for either one.

      "response": "It is widely recognized that many groups are underrepresented in public meetings, voting, and all functions and levels of government, especially people of color, lower income residents, younger people, and working families. Some of it relates to limited time and money. Some of it relates to structural barriers. Some of it relates to a focus only on who is in the room when decisions are made as opposed to asking who isn't, and why. Much of it relates to an over-arching unwillingness to change, and it's a main reason why I am running – to engage more people in the political process and make government more accountable and responsive to more people. This is who I am and what I have always done, from the time I pushed to extend 6th graders the right to vote for Student Member of the Board of Education as our 7th through 12th grade peers could, to my time at University of Maryland leading voter registration drives, protests, and advocacy days and fighting in Annapolis and on Capitol Hill for student voting rights, affordable housing, and college access and affordability. It's why I've helped start multiple national nonprofit advocacy organizations focused on empowering young people and promoting more diverse civic engagement, and it's been a focus of every public role I've in which I've ever served. That's why I have hired specialized communications firms to reach specific communities like with the implementation of a new MVA Certification Law that disproportionately affected residents who didn't speak English as a first language. Similarly, when launching the new Maryland ABLE Disability Savings Accounts, I personally led listening sessions all across the State, worked individually with stakeholder groups, and drastically expanded the staff's community outreach proposal to ensure that we were proactively reaching out and receiving direct input from the people the program was designed to serve. Engaging more residents in the most accessible way has been a primary focus of mine in every role I've been in, it's been a primary focus of our campaign, and it will be a focus of mine as the next County Councilmember from District 1.

      "response": "Metro is a major contributor to our region's economic success. Not only is it critical for moving hundreds of thousands of people to and from jobs across the region every day. Metro has also been instrumental in supporting placemaking across the region, by encouraging more accessible, walkable communities. That is why, I strongly support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro of at least $500 million a year, including at least $167 million from Maryland.    Similar to what is laid out in the proposed Maryland Metro Funding Act, I would support the creation of a Maryland Metro Dedicated Fund Account within the Transportation Trust Fund with mandatory annual appropriations. While the Maryland Metro Funding Act  would rely on existing revenue collected for the Transportation Fund to support Metro, I would instead advocate for the the creation of a 1 percent  regional sales tax. This regional sales tax could help insulate Metro funding from existing fluctuations to revenue streams that support the Transportation Trust Fund and would make more funding available for other important projects that rely on the Fund.    Given the recent challenges faced by Metro and the perceived lack of accountability, a dedicated funding stream can only be successful if taxpayers feel like that money is being used as effectively as possible and is improving the system. That is why I support making several reforms to the existing WMATA Compact to increase accountability. First, I would support a strengthening of  the Office of Inspector General with mandated funding and through increased auditing and staffing decision authority. I would also support strengthening the existing Riders Advisory Council by mandating dedicated funds for its operation and by allowing local jurisdictions to appoint representatives, rather than appointments being determined by WMATA's application process. Metro should also be required to regularly update their strategic plans, something that is already done on an ad hoc basis, and provide ample opportunity for public comment."

With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "I do not support Governor Hogan's splashy but substance-free proposal to expand I-495, I-270, and the BW Parkway. Decades of experience shows us that building more highways can hollow out communities while only leading to more traffic due to induced demand. For this reason, I think transit expansions would instead be a much better use of limited state funds. My priorities specifically would be all-day, two-way MARC service, an infill MARC station in the White-Flint area, and true bus-rapid transit viathe Corridor Cities Transitway, Route 29, and Route 355. I have been a consistent supporter of BRT in Montgomery County, most recently advocating for a study of the BetterBRT plan for 29.    That is all not to say that we should not invest in roadways when appropriate. I, however, would want to make sure that existing repairs are prioritized before adding even more infrastructure. Any additional freeway lanes should come from repurposing existing median space, not widening; I would like to see that new lane space devoted to dedicated transit, such as bus-rapid transit or HOT/HOV lanes. We should be extremely wary of Virginia's model in this regard, where the PPP leading to 66 toll lanes actually forbids expansion of the orange line. I would vehemently oppose any such deals that hamper transit infrastructure to prioritize roads."

      "question": "Do you think the State Highway Administration appropriately balances walking, bicycling, car, and transit needs or does it favor fast car movement to the exclusion of other needs? Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "Like so much of the United States, Maryland is a state built to prioritize the car. And the dominance of the car and its role in shaping infrastructure leads to a vicious cycle where the inconveniences created for non-drivers push them to car-transportation, which degrades the constituency for other forms of transportation, leading to further dominance of the car. Breaking that cycle therefore requires government intervention through smart policy development. Such intervention is justified because this is not a mere policing of preferences; a car-dominant transportation infrastructure has many negative side effects for society. From their large, negative impact on the environment to the injury and death attributable to motor accidents, cars provide many reasons to, if not privilege, at least put on equal footing other forms of transportation.     As a result, I would be a strong proponent of steps to reform the State Highway Administration to be sure that it takes seriously the safety and transportation needs of Marylanders traveling on the state's roads using something other than a car. The SHA currently does not take responsibility for maintaining pedestrian pathways next to its roadways or install crosswalks that would allow pedestrians to cross busy streets. In addition to supporting efforts to get SHA do more in these areas, I would also support innovative and effective approaches to improving pedestrian and bike safety and convenience through traffic control efforts such as HAWK signals and enhanced protections for pedestrians and bikers in crosswalks.     Cars are not going away entirely anytime soon in most of Montgomery County and Maryland. But where we can make it easier and faster to move people (rather than focusing on moving automobiles specifically) we should. It is better for the environment, better for cyclists and transit users, and better for drivers who will have less competition on the roads.  "

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "I believe that a truly successful transit system is safe, reliable, frequent, and accessible to everyone regardless of income. That is why it is critical that the state play a role in ensuring that development in transit-rich areas is truly inclusive and limits the displacement of current residents and businesses as much as possible.     Specifically, the state should consider targeting existing funding for affordable housing to areas that are transit accessible. For example the state could update it's evaluation criteria for Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects to favor those that are in close proximity to transit. I would also the adoption of legislation that would require local governments to spend a portion of any revenue acquired through Tax Increment Financing increments, an approach that relies on increases area property values to pay for economic development, to support local investments in affordable housing. To help local small businesses facing economic pressure, I would also support the creation of targeted grant or loan programs coordinated through the Maryland Small Business Development Financing Authority. I generally support efforts to help businesses along the Purple Line construction route (like on Elm Street west of Wisconsin in Bethesda) weather the next few years of Purple Line construction so that our infrastructure investments do not push out valued members of our business community.    The state should also do all it can to support specific local and regional efforts that promote inclusive development around transit, such as the Purple Line Corridor Action Plan, which aims to support inclusive development in that corridor.

      "response": "Would you like to see Maryland, Virginia, and DC collaborate to avoid a race to the bottom? How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?    Though like many who are hopeful that our region can be a leader in smart development and a strong supporter of reinvesting in our public institutions, I am as concerned about the potential for a race to the bottom dynamic on both a national and local level when it comes to attracting major projects that will affect the area. That said, especially in the Amazon HQ2, I also think they provide a unique and unusual opportunity to galvanize public support around investing in our area. For that reason, I think that we should build our way to being a competitive region to attract external investment, as in HQ2. Amazon (and most knowledge-economy corporations looking to expand) want locations near transit; they want diverse and skilled workers; and they want good schools for their employees' kids. We all want those things, and our efforts should focus on strengthening our area's fundamentals.  And to make sure these efforts strengthen our entire region, I also strongly support working together with other parts of the region to make these investments strategically and in ways that complement one another -- because if any jurisdiction in our area wins Amazon, we all win. In general, though, we should be committing ourselves to investing in schools, especially early childhood education, and transit infrastructure that can not only handle the new influx of residents that would be implied by Amazon moving to our area, but also make sure that it does so at a level that is competitive with the most effective transit systems in the country and world. We should also strive to make housing in the area more affordable so that relocation to the area is an attractive place to stay for new workers who come to the area as a result of new investment.     The same spirit of collaboration is of course also true for Metro, as a successful Metro system will be key to attracting new and valuable development to the area. A system that serves the area effectively and extensively can not only improve the experiences of all residents but also improve the economies across the region.     Though I would generally like to see government get out of the stadium subsidy game altogether, I recognize that there is strong regional support for our sports teams and that the regional cohesion that collective interest provides also should not be overlooked. Nevertheless, I have a few priorities in this regard. First, I would prefer such projects not to take place in areas that could be put to better use with high density housing or building of other sorts, as in the case of RFK stadium and it's long overdue demolition. Second, where such stadium projects do go forward, it's important to recognize that these publicly subsidized projects often result in private benefits. As a result, any publicly funded stadium project should be designed for mixed-use and not just devoted to a single team or sport and otherwise left dormant."

The efforts must be sustained by a continued and stable injection of funds. Key to this effort in continued improvement is increases in personnel to respond faster. Neighborhood traffic studies, for instance, take about 87 days. One area the County can improve on is a legislative push to introduce innovative technologies in the PG county traffic system. For instance, NYC introduced Midtown in Motion to reduce traffic related accidents and increase efficiency. We also have other innovative software that allow city governments to integrate direct user data with smart phones to identify traffic flows, congestions, bottle necks, potholes and accidents. As an example, we can look at Farmington, MI on how they integrate technology using Intellistreets.

The government must soften the negative side-effects of gentrification through temporary subsidies especially to the most vulnerable (elderly and children). The effort should have a short term measure and long term strategy. In the short term, the local government should expand grants to nonprofit organizations that helps the most vulnerable. The decline in the 2018 income disparity grant must be reversed. The long term strategy involves development of mix-housing with a stable funding for nonprofit organizations."

      "response": "Safety for pedestrians and cyclists in Prince George's County is a well-documented issue and there have been few solutions executed to address it. That our roads have not been developed with pedestrians and cyclists in mind is not particularly surprising given the County's historical position in the region—early suburban and now increasingly and decidedly urban in many areas. That does not mean that the County is void of any responsibility in working to make the infrastructure match existing conditions.    New development in the county is often reviewed with an eye towards connectivity through site design and/or contributions or set-asides for infrastructure (e.g., bike share stations, contributions to TDM, etc.). However, that does not address the miles of state and county-owned roadways that are still operated under the premise of “getting from point A to B as quickly as possible.” Additionally, as much as we are focusing on development around metro centers the geographic area of the county without metro adjacency is still quite significant. In other words, connecting people across the county will continue to require the use of cars unless investments are made to enhance transportation (minimizing headway and maximizing routes) within the county and their connections to regional systems. The result is that we have a compounded problem of roads operating as highways through communities with an increasing number of trips and cars per road.     There is absolutely a role for me via the County Council to address this through policy as well as practice. It will be incredibly important that I obtain the commitment of the County Executive's office to prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, particularly in District 2. This is important because departments and their individual work plans are structured according to the executive's priorities and it's critical that attention to this aspect of public safety is infused at every level. The next important relationship is that with the Governor's office and legislators with committee oversight of SHA to ensure the prioritization of improvements to the state-owned roads as the majority of the high-incident areas occur on them. In addition to urging financing of these projects, I will continue to urge that SHA recalibrate its metrics for making determinations for improvements such as traffic signals, crosswalks, lighting, and bollards. The process currently favors motor vehicles and does little to account for decisions that pedestrians and cyclists may make to keep themselves safe in the absence of inherently safe conditions. As a legislator, my influence is best leveraged in crafting the budget to ensure that necessary operational and capital improvements are funded/financed. I would also like to explore ways that the County can help support or assist in the financing of roadway improvement projects that need to happen on roadways owned and maintained by our 27 municipalities."

      "response": "Absolutely. As I mention briefly in the question 1, the lack of connectivity of systems within the county is problematic. It not only almost ensures a continued reliance on single occupancy vehicle trips (and therefore contributing to pedestrian and cyclist safety issues), it also limits economic opportunity for those unable to live near metro centers, complicates parking metrics for redevelopment projects, and necessitates investments in structures like parking garages—investments and land that would be better used in different ways."

We all know that one of the primary reasons individuals opt for alternative means for transportation is that traveling by car is a hassle. Making the highways wider reduces the incentive to take other means of transit and can affect the financial resources available to finance transit projects due to decreased ridership. Additionally, it will undoubtedly impact the natural environment around these highways and create additional habitat issues that we have yet to address with urban development. It is simply shortsighted—it only looks at one solution for an existing problem of traffic and congestion without looking at what is causing that congestion. These issues begin, in large part, in communities around the region. The funding should therefore be directed to solutions in jurisdictions around DC, which may require more collaboration with the District and Virginia."

The second economic development priority (not in ranking or in ordination) is education. Transit oriented development and education go hand-in-hand, especially in Prince George's County. A significant portion of transit development is occurring in areas of the county where the majority of schools already exceed state-rated capacity and also meet qualifications for Title I designation. I will place considerable focus on promoting development strategies that prioritize affordability (and actually putting policies in place that actually implement the Purple Line Community Compact) so that we increase economic opportunity for families in the district and revisit school design in urban settings in collaboration with PGCPS and the BOE.

I agree that ADUs are a reasonable way to allow homeowners to enhance their properties and create additional income and housing opportunities in the face of escalating costs of living. There's a secondary reason why this is meaningful, particularly for district 2: property standards. Without legislation governing the construction and use of ADUs regulating de-facto ADUs is difficult. In district 2 a number of properties have been modified to create “ADUs” that are neither aesthetically pleasing nor safe for habitation. Coupled with an overcrowding bill that does very little, if anything, to address overcrowding, residents in district 2 are living in substandard conditions just to have a roof over their heads while property owners are not held accountable. It is important to me that housing is affordable, but not because it's in poor condition. Having legislation governing ADUs that simultaneously creates an avenue for ensuring code compliance is a win-win for our communities, in my opinion."

Each mile/neighborhood/segment of Route 29 and 650 are unique and present obstacles that removing/altering may be not be a feasible option. For example, adding a dedicated lane along Rt. 29 near White Oak may work, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain that same path as you get closer to downtown Silver Spring because the right-of-way narrows; and the existing housing is very close to the road.

The pedestrian safety improvements on Arlington Road in Bethesda enabling pedestrians to cross all four crosswalks at the same time is a great example of how to implement Vision Zero. In the 1990s, I was the Project Manager of the Kentlands (Gaithersburg) for my land use firm. Working closely with the architects and traffic engineers, we created safer and bike-pedestrian friendly streets that calm traffic with unique devices such as chokers and detailed roundabouts."

      "question": "Montgomery County has many proposed transportation projects, including a county-wide Bus Rapid Transit network, the Corridor Cities Transitway, MARC expansion, widening of I-495 and I-270, Midcounty Highway (M-83), Montrose Parkway East, and more. With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "With respect to prioritizing transportation projects in the County, public transit options should be ideally executed first. More must be done to fund public transit in Montgomery County and our State Delegation must be a larger part of the equation. Transit improvements such as new MARC stations, bus improvements, BRT lanes, and dedicated metro funding are also priorities. The most important transit improvement for the north, the long-awaited Corridor City Transitway should be built now. The first phase of design has been completed, but lacks adequate funding.    With respect to roads, the completion of M-83 or Mid-County Highway is the long promised eastern arterial originally conceived as part of the “ladder arterials” to relieve pressure on I-270 in concert with the western arterial now known as the Great Seneca Highway. Both builders and residents in Clarksburg relied upon the missing 5.7 miles of this road (which were never built) and they now remain trapped in the resulting congestion. Roads are not necessarily evil purveyors of emissions because if growth in a community is inevitable, as it is in Montgomery County, most roadway additions that distribute traffic usually produce positive outcomes with environmentally-sound planning. Previously, the County promised Clarksburg residents (who live in the fastest growing part of the County) a north-south route, but the County failed to meet their needs. As Councilman for District 1, I will properly balance the need for additional roadways and negotiate funding for transit."

      "response": "I believe most citizen's voices are under-represented when it comes to making land use and transportation decisions. This is partially due to so many people busy with work, family, school or lack of access to participate in the process. With respect to individual site plans, the opportunity to participate is slim because a builder is only required to have one public meeting prior to submission to the Planning Board. I would like to increase the required number of meetings pre-submission to at least two so more community voices may be heard. In reference to master/sector plans, in the past, the County Council would hold some of their public meetings within the community (church, school, community center) giving more options for public participation.

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "While building new transit systems have major advantages in creating developments around the areas, however, a major drawback is the unintended consequences.  Studies from across the country show that proximity to transit stations increases land and property values, which in turn decreases housing options for lower-income populations. As a result, transit developments can cause gentrification that price out moderate- and low-income families. As a Delegate I will work to adopt programs that have worked around the country. There are several strategies for creating affordable, transportation-oriented housing. For example, as new units appear along transportation lines, cities can prioritize access to Housing and Urban Development voucher holders. In some cases, housing authorities purchase new units and offer them to voucher holders themselves. Cities also encourage affordable housing near transportation lines through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, which offers federal funds to states in support of affordable housing development. I will urge our state to maintain affordable, transportation-oriented units over time by amending federal HOME block grants. Units built with HOME grants must remain affordable for a period ranging from five to 20 years, but may increase in price after this period expires. Extending these periods is one way to maintain housing affordability near transportation lines. However, transportation lines last decades beyond the longest affordability periods currently used. Genuinely long-term affordable housing can be achieved through shared-equity programs owned by Community Land Trusts. These Trusts are non-profit organizations that purchase land and lease units at subsidized rates. Lessees will agree to share part of a home's equity with the Trust upon resale, keeping homes affordable for new buyers. Trusts also reuse their share of each home's equity to subsidize new buyers, resulting in long-term affordability."

      "response": "I support plans for bus lanes and bike lanes with one safety exception regarding the 2008 Transportation Master Plan as Amended in 2016. Rapid transit and bike lanes are critical in a progressive, eco-friendly, and health-conscious City like Alexandria. Expanded networks of bus and bike lanes will save riders time, reduce congestion, and support environmentally friendly behavior (even more so when buses – are electric). These networks are even more appealing when they help to connect our community with neighboring counties like Arlington. Moreover, these measures support Plan Zero efforts here in Alexandria.     I do worry about the safety of bikers on some bike lanes. For the safety of these riders, I would encourage lowering speed limits in these areas and to improve enforcement of these limits.     I also think reducing the number of lanes is something to revisit in the near future. Surveys show that most bikers ride for recreation purposes; only about 23 percent used bikes to get to work. As the numbers of riders increase - and as more employers build in house showers for bike riders, the bike lanes will be used for recreational purposes. I do, however, support narrowing some limited existing lanes for fast bus lanes."

I would like to see more of the empty buildings occupied by businesses that will eventually help bring in more revenue to the city with the hope that this new revenue.. Developing more shared parking lots will allow small business owners to operate without having to pay extra for parking. Reduced parking requirements will also ensure less motor vehicle congestions, thereby advancing the goals of Vision Zero.     At the same time, I am mindful that reduced parking also may cause many drivers who live outside of “enhanced” transit areas not to visit businesses for fear of lacking of pakring. I believe it is critical for the City to spend time educating residents about how reduced parking limits can jumpstart local small businesses (which currently constitutes 90% of Virginia's economy!) while acknowledging the limited cons associated with the reduction."

      "response": "To compete regionally, the City must modernize. At the same time, Alexandria has a unique identity given its history as a colonial city. This history is crucial to Alexandria's economic viability as a tourist destination in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Responsible development is the key to successful growth and continued ability to accommodate our growing population. Our population does not just include the growth of single-person households, but also an increase in the number of households with young children.       Rapid development without proper planning creates more issues that it will solve. More developments must account for increased need for schools, hospitals, parks, and other social services critical to a growing population. I would work with City Staff and residents to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the full spectrum of needs that development brings. Developers who wish to be part of our community must be do so responsibly while working to ensure housing is affordable and cease from creating nuisances to property rights.     We must also invest in a community that is more equitable. To that end, we have to be mindful that increased development won't continue to push certain groups of people out of our City. Alexandria has always been a diverse city: this diversity is part of our history, enriches our culture, and is part of the very fabric of our community.     With a responsible, forward-thinking approach, the West-End would be an ideal candidate for development – especially the Landmark area. Despite approval, the Landmark Malll remains underdeveloped, which harms our tax revenue (potential millions from Landmark Mall).   "

      "response": "It is difficult to comment on that before the March 14, 2018 recommendation from ARHA is out. However, public housing is none-negotiable part of my platform. Resolution 830 is a strong guard against dealing away with our 1,150 public housing units. Any plans that attempt to remove, temper, or water down Resolution 830 will simply not have my approval – unless there is a concomitant plan to develop other public housing options.  Frankly, these units do not currently accommodate all those who qualify. The waitlist for public housing is long and the process complicated. This is not acceptable. Just recently, a resident who waited years for public housing was finally approved. However, before the individual could find a unit that qualified, ARHA informed them that funding had run out and they had to wait again.

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "3.\\tAs a rapidly growing county we face enormous problems finding solutions to our infrastructure needs. We are reaching the limits of our ability to borrow money to fund infrastructure improvements. Worsening congestion in the county will require both road and transit improvements. We will require us to look for the least expensive alternative that meets the need.    My first priority would be to look to innovative new transit strategies such as micro-transit and flexible transit to supplement our present transit systems.  Other communities that have used these strategies have found them to work well in urban areas that are underserved by existing fixed transit systems as well as in lower density areas where fixed transit systems might not be economically feasible-such as Clarksburg which was promised transit years ago but has been left with inadequate roads and no transit.     I oppose the M-83 highway.  It is an environmental monstrosity and too expensive.  Local road improvements and flexible transit would be cheaper solutions.  The Montrose Parkway East proposal is an expensive and outdated solution.  The money would be better spent on other projects. I also oppose widening I495 which would involve too much disruption of local neighborhoods.  We should look at bottleneck areas on the beltway such as the I 270 intersection and the American Legion Bridge.  I do believe that adding two reversible lanes on I 270 might be an improvement but only of the traffic can merge smoothly once it reaches 495.    I support BRT where dedicated lanes can be built.  I support the Corridor Cities Transitway and MARC expansion.  However, these projects will require substantial aid from the state or federal governments.

      "response": "5.\\tThe first and most important step is to stop tearing down affordable housing.  We have been tearing down more affordable housing than we build.  Some sector plans have aggravated this trend by zoning for high density in areas where lower density, affordable housing exists.     There are two existing programs that I we should make greater use of.  The first is the right of first refusal authorized in Chapter 53A of the Montgomery County Code which allows tenant groups to match any signed contract for the sale of multifamily properties containing four or more units.  The County should work to organize and educate tenants about this program and offer low interest loans to groups who wish to purchase their units.      The second is the Workforce Housing Program which increases the availability of housing in the County for public employees and other workers whose income cannot support the high cost of housing that is located close to their workplace and who, as a result, are increasingly priced out of housing opportunities.  The program was initially mandatory when it was passed in 2005 but was changed to voluntary.  I think it should be made mandatory again so that public employees have the opportunity to live near where they work"

      "response": "I support the proposal to build affordable senior housing and childcare on the property, both of which are needed. In general, I believe the county has approved new sector plans without any provision for the infrastructure needed to support them. As a result we have the most overcrowded schools of any county in the state, roads that are ever more crowded and declining in quality, and a transit system that is badly underfunded.  I believe we need to tighten the adequate public facilities regulations to slow development until our infrastructure has caught up with demand. "

Perhaps the most disturbing example has been the cover up of child abusers in the public school systems.  Child abusers have been knowingly kept on for years and parents who have tried to get information on the problem have been stonewalled and harassed.

Generally, State roads are designed for vehicular traffic and depending on the road classification (arterial, collector, etc.) the balance of focus should be different.  A state road that is within a residential community should have proper traffic/speed calming devices to allow for me pedestrian and cycling needs.

Federal employees residing in Maryland use Metro in the tens of thousands every day.  In my judgment, an important first step toward fostering greater federal interest in ensuring adequate Metro funding would be to improve Maryland's relationship with the federal Executive Branch.   Moreover, I believe the Maryland General Assembly ought to expect more from Maryland's U.S. congressional delegation.  Finally, to generate more of its own revenue for transportation infrastructure, the Maryland General Assembly should attach higher priority to finding its share of Metro funding, and to making Maryland more economically-attractive to investment and job creation.

Our region is of critical importance to transportation east of the Mississippi because of a unique convergence of road, rail, and shipping.  Geographically, Baltimore is the westernmost U.S. Atlantic coast port.  Because of the critical importance of I-495, I-270, and the BW Parkway to Atlantic seaboard transport, expansion of these important arteries is vital.  I would include improvements to U.S. Route 1 as well as Maryland Routes 201, 4 and 5 on my own priority list.  As Maryland legislators it is also impossible to disregard the transportation challenges presented in other parts of our state.    The question tells the story:  the transportation infrastructure resource \"pie\" is too small.  How do we enlarge it?  Here is a place to start:  working better with the federal government to take full advantage of the federal transportation funding stream;  increasing Maryland revenues by making our state more attractive to investment and job-creation of all kinds;  and eliminating self-inflicted factors aggravating congestion on area roadways."

      "response": "I enjoy walking and riding my bicycle very much.  But the task of the Maryland General Assembly, in my opinion, is to make traffic more fluid, not less.  The high speed automobile remains the centerpiece of transportation in the industrialized world and will for the foreseeable future.  It is unsurprising, therefore, that Maryland and other states devote significant resources to supporting this mode of transportation.  When a tipping point is reached in a different direction, I believe policymakers, legislators and voters will perceive it.   We are not there yet.    In the meantime, making provisions for safer walking and biking is absolutely critical -- especially in in Prince George's County.  In my judgment, rather than more SHA oversight and policies, the solution is an aggressive construction program of wide, set-back sidewalks and serviceable off-street bike commuting routes.  Further blending of bicycle riders and pedestrians with fast car movement will produce more congestion and more fatalities.   "

How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "In March, 2018, I believe the most important relationship where collaboration is lacking is that between Maryland and the federal Executive Branch.  If elected to the General Assembly, I will do my utmost to change this.    All things being equal, collaboration is preferable but often elusive.  In my judgment, a path to collaboration is to identify problems around which a united front can be built.  A case in point is congestion on Interstate 95, which afflicts all three of the noted jurisdictions.    Of the three examples included in the question (Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a new football stadium) two of the three entail private entities.  Although it does not always seem this way, Metro is the best bet for for regional consensus, at least as a starting point, to deal effectively with the system's problems and finances.    With regard to the other two (Amazon and football) or to other commercial enterprises, to collaborate and find consensus could, in a way, require at least one of the jurisdictions to disregard the different economic and taxation environments in the other two.  Maryland and the District, as taxing authorities, are different from Virginia.   In my judgment, Virginia will never willingly surrender its advantages.  The solution for Maryland and its General Assembly is to equal or surpass Virginia as a jurisdiction that is economically-attractive to the private sector.    The question brings to mind two additional points.  First, the \"other\" Amazon presence in our state is the company's large warehouse near Point Breeze in the Port of Baltimore.  There are roadways in Afghanistan in better condition than the Keith Avenue roadway connecting the Amazon facility to the interstate.    In the General Assembly, Port of Baltimore infrastructure will always be a high priority for me because of the Port's statewide economic impact.    Finally, another transportation concept that could reduce I-95 congestion in our region is generally overlooked:  short-sea shipping.  The most recent report I can find on the subject, commissioned in 2013 by the Maryland Port Authority and other regional authorities, was silent on Sparrows Point, where the  former Bethlehem Steel site, today known as Tradepoint Atlantic, is undergoing a logistics renaissance (EAST COAST MARINE HIGHWAY INITIATIVE M-95 STUDY, FINAL REPORT, October 2013).  In Virginia, private enterprise has established a short sea shipping tug/barge service from Hampton Roads upstream along the James River.  I believe this service demonstrates how the other shared asset in our region -- the Chesapeake Bay -- offers another avenue to reducing congestion that ought to be leveraged to reduce road congestion."

      "response": "Yes, I absolutely support dedicated funding for the Metro and believe that this should be a priority for the Montgomery County delegation in the General Assembly. The Metro funding campaign's formula calls for $167 million from Maryland, which I support. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments released a report last year that considered several means of raising revenue for the Metro, including a property tax and a gas tax. They concluded that a 1% regional sales tax is the best option. The COG found that as the source of funding for most large transit systems in the nation, a sales tax would be equitable since it spreads the cost widely and would include funds from tens of millions of annual visitors. This seems reasonable to me, and if any other steps are required to achieve dedicated funding (such as a reform board), I would require that labor play a meaningful part in that conversation."

For example, I support HB580, which would allow some payment flexibility as many people who receive benefits do so during the middle of the month instead of the beginning of the month, when rent is often due. I oppose HB472, which would expand the definition of rent to also include utilities against the findings of the MD Court of Appeals Lockett v. Blue Ocean Bristol decision.

For this reason, I support the efforts to conduct the US 29 Mobility and Reliability Study (a.k.a Better BRT Plan) to determine the benefits of having dedicated bus lanes between New Hampshire Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway."

      "response": "I support the concept of Vision Zero, as well as the plan developed by the County. Both plans have the right mix of engineering, enforcement, and education to come close to the goals by 2030. I believe the priority for engineering should be focused on re-engineering intersections. Past County efforts have reduced collisions and pedestrian injuries at some of our past troublesome intersections. Updating road standards also should be a high priority as the County grows along major arteries, such as the I-270 corridor feeder roads and U.S. 29."

      "question": "Montgomery County has many proposed transportation projects, including a county-wide Bus Rapid Transit network, the Corridor Cities Transitway, MARC expansion, widening of I-495 and I-270, Midcounty Highway (M-83), Montrose Parkway East, and more. With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "All of these projects should remain on the County's transportation plans. I believe expansion of BRT in the East County should be a priority because of the lack of Metro access in that area. I also support studying options for a “Better BRT”. My second priority would be promoting the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT) because of the population growth taking place Upcounty, which leads to challenges for reducing traffic on I-270. As originally approved, the CCT was planned as a light rail from the Shady Grove Metro station, through the Rockville science corridor, to Gaithersburg, Germantown, and Clarksburg. Although the County has revised light rail to BRT, I believe the next County Council should revisit the light rail option to have a greater impact on an already crowded roads in these areas.     Additionally, I would like to see more funding for public transportation options before widening I-270 and I-495. The only way to reduce motorized traffic is to give people options that encourage them not to drive. MARC expansion, Mid-County Highway (M83), and Montrose Parkway East are my lowest priorities."

      "response": "Yes, I agree with the zoning changes to streamline approval for multi-family housing. I also strongly agree with reducing the minimum parking requirement within ½ mile of Metro and ¼ mile of Purple Line, MARC, and BRT stations. As the Rental Housing Study mentions, minimum parking requirements have been found to create an excess of parking spaces, which can lead to a higher cost in development and reduced amounts of affordable housing options.

      "response": "As mentioned in the Rental Housing Study, one way to close this gap would be to implement a “sliding scale” approach to the MPDU program allowing for the customization of income targeting based from AMI. (e.g. 30% AMI, 50% AMI, 80% AMI and/or 100% AMI) and set aside percentages (e.g. 5%, 10%, 15%, and/or 20%).  I believe this can help close the gap for our residents living under 50% AMI.

      "response": "While the planning and approval process in the County includes opportunities for public and commercial input at various stages, I believe more must be done to bring in groups and individuals that are not now participating in these processes. Unless a person or group is attuned to the process through membership in an organization or part of a community group, there is little chance to be informed of these public hearings. Specifically, we must receive input from lower-income residents, which often includes minority communities, and also small business owners. We need to engage them so that they understand the processes involved with land use and transportation decisions. I believe as a Councilmember, it is my responsibility to provide outreach to those communities to inform them of how the process works and when and where they can provide input. In addition, we must recognize that not everyone can provide their input in the same way. The County must create opportunities to allow the community to provide input at their own convenience, such as recording video testimonies using their cell phone, YouTube, or on social media.     I also believe we should engage residents who may not rely on the Internet to seek out information about these issues. I will investigate to see if the County can provide information and notices in a manner that provides these residents who do not use the internet with information on the issues. "

      "response": "Yes, I support dedicated funding annually that includes at least $167 million from Maryland.  However, Maryland's Governor, unlike many states, wields significant budgetary power and holds Metro funding hostage at times.  In order to supplement budgetary shortcomings for Metro, I would fund Metro through the legalization of recreational marijuana to take marijuana out of the hands of criminals and into government hands so we can tax it and meet the minimum goal of $167 million. Simultaneously, this will reduce crime in District 20 and around Maryland. Other steps I will support include how we can involve our unions into the conversation of Metro development.  Having been born and raised in Youngstown, OH, I come from a family of steel and auto workers.  I believe in the right to organize and collective bargaining.  My experience as a community organizer in the metro region's LGBTQ community (I founded the DC area's first LGBTQ billiards league and fundraised with Governor Martin O'Malley for the 2012 Maryland Marriage Equality campaign) is a testament on how I will organize and bargain for the citizens of District 20 within the Maryland House of Delegates.

      "response": "I do not support Governor Hogan's proposed expansions as they currently stand because doing so will run contrary to Montgomery County's written obligations to reduce carbon footprints.  After carefully examining available public funding and transportation programs which the state currently funds, I will support transit expansion that benefits the citizens of District 20, which includes (but is not limited to): MARC, BRT, smart Purple Line development, and public/private oriented transit options.  The underlying goal is for families in District 20 to get to and from work and school while protecting our environment and easing the tax burdens on residents.

Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "I believe that finding a balanced approach to transit needs is a daunting task for the SHA because of Montgomery County's rapidly growing population.  Unlike many other places in Maryland, Montgomery County and District 20 face unique challenges that require targeted cooperation with the SHA and the County Council. Partnering with all levels of government and private entities will result in increased pedestrian safety and dedicated bike lanes, proper road construction that does not kill the environment, and Bus Rapid Transit.  If Governor Larry Hogan had his way, the SHA would favor fast car movement that ignores and excludes alternative transit needs.  I absolutely support changes that make our streets safer, even if it slows down traffic.  For example, many roads like East West Highway have dangerous crosswalks that make it near impossible for pedestrians and bikers to cross during rush hour and at nighttime.  I will work with state government agencies and the County Council to implement signals like those located at the intersection of 16th Street and Jonquil Street in NW DC to create safer environments for bikers and pedestrians. These signals will only halt traffic when they are activated, unlike regular traffic signals.  Providing safer transit alternatives means fighting for Social & Economic Justice, Cultural Awareness, and the Environment."

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "Yes.  I strongly support regulations that supply the needs of transit demands so long as our families, schools, local economy, and the environment are not severely handicapped. We must first ensure that our families do not become displaced like some local businesses and guarantee that multiple transit options are available to them, including the Purple Line, Metro, Bus Rapid transit development, and biker and pedestrian options. These transit options must be affordable too.  Because transit development is expensive, we must insist that our County's overcrowded schools receive the overdue funding our school system needs to improve while creating new-transit. Transit-rich areas must also include affordable housing, especially for renters.  I support certain rent control policies and will propose incentives for families and individuals wanting to remain in District 20 who would otherwise become “priced-out” within transit-rich communities.  I also support affordable housing centered near transit areas, which may benefit low-income families and possibly house homeless individuals too. Immigration is the driving force behind our County's population growth, so we must practice cultural awareness. I support the application of cultural competence programs to educate our diverse community and enable to provide transit and housing services effectively to individuals of all backgrounds social and economic backgrounds. Regarding our local economy, I support MD State Senator Will Smith's (District 20) legislative efforts to protect existing businesses that are dramatically affected by Purple Line Development.  Businesses are being forced to either close or relocate due to Purple Line construction.  If elected, I will support similar measures that protect our local economy and empower local businesses to keep their doors open.  However, sometimes bringing in new business near transit-rich areas may scare residents just as much as businesses that are closing. Should Montgomery County become home to Amazon's new headquarters, we must be prepared for negative consequences on our roads, transit costs, and over-priced housing.  We must work closely with our County government to create a smooth transition if we are selected for the new headquarters and provide as many government-sponsored and public/private partnership transit offerings as possible. Finally, we must remember to reduce our County's carbon footprint and protect the environment. Montgomery County is part of the Under 2 Coalition and pledged a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Transit projects must not jeopardize this goal.  Altogether, much is possible when it comes to transit policies. My policy background and experience as an attorney will allow me to support pragmatic and progressive policies for the citizens of District 20 and around Maryland."

How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "Maryland, Virginia, and DC must collaborate on common ground issues because our metro region's survival depends on it.  First and foremost, our region must present a unified front for the prevention of gun violence. We are all numb from the sickness of mass shooting massacres. I remember first moving to Virginia in 2002 and living in fear of the DC Sniper. Even more horrifying, I was the victim of gun violence during a home invasion in Baltimore City in 2005.  When Congress and Donald fail to act after being bombarded by overwhelming opposition, our region must unite and fight this fight together. Mental health awareness is part of gun reform too.  My experience as the legal representative for Montgomery County's Mental Health Association has given me the experience to become a part of this regional conversation. Additionally, we should unite around the #metoo movement and create a region that rids itself of sexual harassment and abuse.  I am an openly gay man who survived sexual abuse as a teenager. I also worked for His Eminence Cardinal William H. Keller in the Office of Child and Youth Protection at the Archdiocese of Baltimore.  My role involved training individuals in parishes and schools around Maryland how to recognize signs of child sexual abuse when I refused to do it for myself. I coordinated efforts with the Archdiocese of Washington as well, so I have a proven track record of working with large organizations within our region.  Again, when Congress and Donald fail to act, we must unite to fund transit options together, collaborate on affordable housing policies (my role on the Montgomery County Children's Panel introduced me to innovative approaches to foster youth housing opportunities), and find the best fit for a new stadium where all three regions will benefit and enjoy it.  We must also realize that if Amazon comes to Montgomery County (which will make up for job loss with Discovery Communications leaving District 20), our entire region will benefit from job creation and the citizens from Virginia and DC will likely become Amazon employees.  If elected, I will hold public forums for District 20 constituents to carefully listen to their concerns before casting any vote in Annapolis.  It is our campaign's hope that we earn the endorsement of Greater Greater Washington, continue to work with the organization's members going forward, and make the above priorities happen for the betterment of District 20 and the DC Region as a whole. This is what true Social & Economic Justice, Cultural Awareness, and our Environment is all about.  Thank you."

In addition to providing employment opportunities, participation in some type of financial literacy program should be a condition of some mortgage loans.      Evictions are normally associated with rental properties, so I propose the establishment of financial literacy and financial counseling programs that can be held at major apartment complexes on a quarterly basis.  Tenants can receive tips on managing their finances, creating a budget, and where to seek assistance before a financial crisis occurs.      Foreclosures are normally associated with mortgaged properties, so the tide of foreclosures could be stemmed by educating home buyers before they obtain a mortgage.  Potential buyers should be educated on the varying types of home loans, and cautioned against buying more home than they can comfortably afford.   As an attorney, I have participated in training programs that were established to provide pro bono assistance to home owners facing possible foreclosure; I believe a similar program can be reinstituted so that lawyers are available to provide guidance and assistance to homeowners fighting to avoid foreclosure.

I believe we need to continue to use the Charrette process, and we need to ensure that all who will potentially be affected by different land use and transportation decisions are invited to participate. We also need to be mindful that some people affected by these projects will not be able to attend a community meeting, and we need to find ways to ensure they can be part of the planning process, too."

      "question": "Prince George's County is the most dangerous in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. Why do you think this is? Is there a role for you in changing this?",
      "response": "One of the major problems is that for decades new developments were not required to be more accommodating to cyclists or pedestrians.  The lack of sufficient crosswalks, bike lanes, and sidewalks has led to many deaths and injuries in our county. Fortunately, certain measures have been implemented to improve this situation such as the 2017-2020 Strategic Roadway Safety Plan (SRSP) which is a comprehensive approach involving local, state, and regional agencies working together to make our roads safe. As County Council, I will build upon the work that has been started and be an advocate for legislation that continues to make road safety a priority for our county and especially for our most vulnerable users. I will work to make sure we have better emerging mixed-use developments in Prince George's county. We have to continue to push for Smart Growth principles, especially, the integration of pedestrian, bicycle, public and private transit."

      "response": "Yes, I think it is imperative that public transportation is provided to workers who do not work 9-5 jobs. Public transportation provides an economical means for workers to get to and from their jobs to take care of their families, as well as, reduces traffic and pollution. We also have to account for people that do not drive that need access to public transportation 7 days a week."

      "response": "I believe we have to start by bringing high quality, high paying jobs to Prince George's County, improving the public education system, and attracting quality of life businesses to the county. There is evidence that high income families are moving out of the county. This is likely a phenomenon of two factors: (a) difficulty in finding high quality housing and (b) access to high quality public education. Also, many areas in the County (District 7 being one) lack easy to reach amenities, whether recreational, food markets, restaurants, etc. While there have been positive changes in the past few years, much work still needs to be done. I believe we do this by creating a systematic approach and a long-term strategy that looks at all the moving parts. I would start with supporting the fight for $15, creating a small business grant focused on incubator projects and funding a community school pilot program. I think that we have to look at the intersectionality of all the issues we face and create a comprehensive strategy."

I will support legislation that ties new affordable housing to state and local subsidies to real estate developers.  I will also advocate for implementation of a dedicated affordable housing fund that will support building new affordable housing units for very-low wage workers and their families. I also believe that we have to make sure that our housing strategy meets the needs of all our citizen both senior citizens and millennials.       My priority with evictions and foreclosures will be prevention assistance, doing everything we can to keep families in their homes. Prevention assistance will include partnering with both public and private organizations to provide financial assistance to cover mortgage, rent, utilities, and medical bills that may have created financial hardship.  Also services such as mediation with lenders/landlords, counseling, and connections with job opportunities/training will be provided.  It is important that we address all these issues to provide families with the tools to prevent evictions and foreclosures in the future.   "

      "response": "A healthy Metro system is essential for the region's vitality.  It is key to reducing traffic congestion, improving environmental sustainability, and providing transportation options for everyone.  It is also a smart investment in the region's future, as employers are increasingly demanding world class transit when choosing where to locate.  The current lack of dedicated funding is clearly the major impediment to achieving this.    Maryland needs to provide permanent, dedicated funding and put maintenance of Metro ahead of expanding the system.  The alternative is a continuation of the frequent disruptions that threaten to plunge Metro into a death spiral.  I am supportive of Maryland providing $125 million a year in permanent funding for Metro from the state's Transportation Trust Fund.  I support the legislation that is currently under consideration in the state legislature (SB 277 and HB 372) that would achieve this goal, contingent upon DC and Virginia also providing dedicated funds."

With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "Public transportation is key to addressing our region's traffic congestion.  Maryland needs to invest more in new public transportation, including the Purple Line and Bus Rapid Transit in Montgomery County.  These new lines will provide much needed options for people to commute, go to school, and run errands.    The Hogan plan to widen the Beltway, I-270, and other highways would create many problems, without providing lasting relief to the congestion that chokes our region.  Studies and decades of real world experience have shown that road widening induces more traffic and does not provide a durable solution to congestion.  Moreover, there are many residential and business properties in Rockville and Gaithersburg that are located very close to I-270.  Widening the highway would likely require government taking of properties, which would be disruptive to communities and would be very expensive."

      "question": "Do you think the State Highway Administration appropriately balances walking, bicycling, car, and transit needs or does it favor fast car movement to the exclusion of other needs? Would you support changes to SHA oversight and policies to make streets safer for walking and biking even if it slows down car traffic?",
      "response": "We need to make our streets safer for pedestrians and bicyclists.  People must be safe and also feel safe to choose to get out of their cars.  That's why I'm pushing for the statewide adoption of Vision Zero.  Vision Zero has been successful in other states and countries in decreasing deaths and serious injuries on roadways and in increasing people's comfort with using alternate modes of transportation, such as bicycling and walking.  Vision Zero calls for better street design, better education for both drivers and pedestrians, and reducing conflicts between fast moving cars and vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and bicyclists.    Existing state policy can also be improved.  Even though the state adheres to a “complete streets” policy, the results are less than stellar.  For instance, in District 17 there is a very busy six-lane road (Shady Grove Road) where the state installed a bike lane immediately next to traffic going in excess of 45 miles per hour.  With no buffer from the vehicles, very few bicyclists feel safe using this bike infrastructure.  SHA should be pursuing separated bike paths along high speed roads.  This is the only way to draw more bicycle users.  I'll note that as an avid bicyclist, I've ridden all 65 miles of Rockville's bike infrastructure and I was proud to champion Rockville's new bikeways master plan, which will increase the lane miles of bike infrastructure by 40% over the next decade."

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "The lack of affordable housing is clearly a major issue for the DC metropolitan region.  Montgomery County and Rockville each have strong requirements in regard to creating new affordable housing units when new housing is built.  In Rockville, more than 650 Moderately Priced Dwelling Units have been built over the past decade as part of new development projects.  These units are available for rent or sale to households making 60% or less of the area median income.  This program should be a model for other communities in Maryland.    The region's tight housing marketing is certainly contributing to the affordable housing problem.  Since zoning is a responsibility of county and sometime municipal governments, the state is somewhat limited in the steps it can take.  That said, I would support a new state requirement for counties and applicable municipalities to include housing in their master plans.  Housing is presently an optional element.  By making it a state requirement, county and local governments would have to determine their ability to meet their future housing needs and to formulate a plan to meet those needs."

I do tend to agree with a sales tax to get us there. However, as for Metro's future in the region, the Federal government must start investing.  We can not rely on Md, Va andDc footing the bill.

I have supported and voted for the Potomac Yard Transitway, Alexandria's first Bus Rapid Transit as well as voted for funding the West End Transitway, which will be coming to Alexandria soon (fingers crossed). I am interested in having Alexandria make some real decisions to move forward with BRT on Duke Street (Corridor B) and also on Eisenhower Avenue, as those two of the city's East-West . As a city council liaison to the city's Transportation Commission, I am also interested in starting long-term discussions about future opportunities to expand and connect the BRT in corridor A (Henry/Patrick Street) with Fairfax County, as additional residential development south of Alexandria on Route 1 is going to necessitate the need to look at solutions for moving people through corridor.     Regarding bike lanes, I have voted for and supported the King Street Bike lanes which removed parking and removed driving lanes and narrowed driving lanes on King Street. I have supported staff efforts to make improvements for the benefit of pedestrians and bikes such as the changes to street infrastructure near end of Van Dorn Street and King Street and I will continue to support future opportunities to improve multi-modal transportation in this way."

Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "As the Council begins receiving and reviewing the Comprehensive Plan amendments, I look forward to hearing from many residents about how this document can help guide the District's growth and prioritize our shared goals. The lens I will bring to the Comp Plan review will put a focus on land use choices that 1) create and preserve affordable housing, 2) invest in more equitable transportation choices, 3) more aggressively pursue sustainability and resiliency policies, and 4) create more geographic equity and access in job creation.    I support the preservation and expansion of affordable housing in all parts of the District - and Ward 6 is leading the way. In the last three years, more than 1,300 affordable homes have been created in Ward 6 with another 1,500 currently in the pipeline. That's more than any other Ward in the District, but still not nearly enough. I also continue to champion the creation of larger units of affordable housing, such as the effort I led to convert the new construction at 13th and H Streets, NE into a 100% affordable project comprised of all 2- and 3-bedroom homes. And when affordable housing is being redeveloped, I am a leading voice to deliver for long-time residents, such as in Sursum Corda in Northwest where every home is now guaranteed to be replaced, or at Greenleaf Gardens in Southwest, where I'm leading a Build First effort to ensure new housing is built first to avoid displacement during the redevelopment of this critical public housing for our city.     I also believe that the issue of affordability needs to be attacked from multiple angles -- including strengthening protections for current tenants. For example, one of the first things I did last year when I became chair of the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety was to move $4.5 million to fund the Expanding Access to Justice Act of 2017 - also known as housing Civil Gideon - to ensure that low-income tenants have an attorney in housing or eviction proceedings to level the playing field, stay in their homes, and fight for a fair deal. Why is this needed? Because almost 90 percent of residents facing eviction do so without an attorney, while almost 90 percent of landlords in eviction proceedings are represented by counsel. That inequity in legal representation leads to vastly disproportionate outcomes in stable housing for renters."

I have supported and will continue to support the expansion of dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes - even if that requires removing or moving on-street parking in some cases. As a regular bus and bike commuter, I not only know that these investments can improve transit choices, I live it, too. And as the 2018 Chair of the region's Transportation Planning Board (TPB), I am proud that I am in a position to help advance many of these investments -- whether building DDOT bus and bike plans into long-term budgets or helping approve the “bicycle beltway” that will make 60 miles of marked trails looping around the region and connecting across the District. Further, as we look to meet the needs in the District for safe and convenient connections, protected bike lanes are necessary to create a north-south mid-city connection, such as on 6th Street NW, and an east-west connection from Southeast through Southwest near M Street and Maine Avenue, SW. And as we look to invest in dedicated bus infrastructure, the District needs to view our ongoing maintenance projects on streets and corridors as opportunities to add these transit connections rather than as discrete capital projects."

      "response": "Yes, I support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year. The District is willing to make the investment needed for dedicated Metro funding, but we must have Virginia and Maryland join this critical effort. Ideally, the federal government would also be a committed partner in this effort, but we cannot wait for that to happen. I have used my role as Chair of the Transportation Planning Board this year to build partnerships with regional elected officials, reinforcing the responsibility we share to improve and stabilize long-term funding for Metro. I also believe these funding commitments should not be tied to governance or labor changes, which more often than not will only serve to delay or excuse the financial commitment that is needed for Metro.    As the region continues to focus on Metro, I remain concerned that attention and focus is being shifted away from Metrobus operations and availability. As a regular Metrobus rider, I know first-hand the important role our bus lines play in connecting DC residents to jobs, and connecting neighborhoods within our city. Last year, I used my position as Chair of the Access for All committee of the Transportation Planning Board to lead a broad coalition of residents and vulnerable communities to publicly criticize the WMATA Board's decisions to increase fares disproportionately on bus trips, as well as their decision to end late-night rail service. Both of these decisions disproportionately hurt vulnerable and low-income communities in the District.

I have been disappointed to see funding delayed or redirected, but remain optimistic that my Council colleagues and the Mayor will deliver the extensions the H Street line must have to be a viable long-term transit option.    But improved transit connections for the District and region won't be solved by streetcar alone. There is a stark east-wide divide in our region - and our city - that requires we apply an equity lens to our investments in transportation that connect residents to jobs, schools, and businesses. As the recent chair of the Access for All committee of the Transportation Planning Board, I worked with transportation planners and leaders, as well as leading advocates for traditionally underserved communities, to create a new way to measure and hold projects accountable for equity investments. In that spirit, I also penned a recent op/ed that outlined 5 different ways we need to invest in the region over the next several decades to improve commuting times, increase access to jobs, and reduce harmful emissions from too much traffic (https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/02/06/viewpoint5-ideas-for-a-better-regional.html).    To grow the District and the region in a sustainable manner that extends well beyond moving people around by cars, we need policies, laws, and leadership to rethink how our city is built and remove the expectation of “free parking” at the end of a commute. I've introduced the Transportation Benefits Equity Amendment Act of 2017 (also known as the Parking Cashout bill) to help treat DC residents more equitably and reduce the built-in incentives for single-occupancy vehicle trips. I've introduced the Daytime School Parking Zone Amendment Act of 2017 to give school communities the opportunity to prioritize outdoor playground or field spaces for children over on-site parking when we modernize our public school buildings. This would reduce the built-in incentives to drive and count on free parking in the school parking lot.     Our residents need access to multiple modes of travel in order to get to jobs, schools, and businesses and I'm committed to finding multiple methods to achieve that access."

      "question": "Last year, the DC Council approved $36 million in tax-increment financing to subsidize 600 additional parking spaces at Union Market. Are you supportive of the way that TIF proceeded or would you like to see changes for future TIFs, regarding parking and/or in general?",
      "response": "I have previously outlined my thoughts on the Union Market TIF vote here (https://ggwash.org/view/65516/here-is-charles-allens-response-to-constituents-concerned-about-his-union-market-tif-vote). But the debate helped highlight the flaws in the way our TIFs are constructed, evaluated, and proposed to Council. Once sent to Council for a vote, very little can be amended without putting the entire effort - and its associated housing and job creation - in jeopardy. Further, the Council is at a severe disadvantage with so little information being shared to allow for an independent evaluation. The debate on this bill was a worthwhile public discussion, and led me to author Bill 22-620, the Tax Increment Financing Transparency Amendment Act of 2017, with Councilmember Elissa Silverman. My legislation would require more information up front to consider and encourage affordable housing and non-automotive transportation investments. It would also require applicants to detail these investments in a way that has never before been shared and disclosed within a TIF application, allowing a more robust understanding of the TIF before its consideration by Council. It would also create a significant shift in requiring development seeking public subsidy to create a higher priority on non-auto-based investments. I am pushing for a public hearing on my bill and will work to get it moved forward."

Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",

We need to protect a neighborhood's character without pricing out existing and potential residents. There are various models across the country, and the District needs to examine their successes and challenges to see if we can craft a policy that will work here."

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "The District does face significant income inequality, but as with any complex issue, there is not a single legislative or government initiative that would serve as a magic bullet. We must continue to implement progressive economic justice policies, such as an increased minimum wage, paid family leave, and expanded access to child care -- policies I have adamantly supported and led. We also must commit to improving adult education, job training, and apprenticeship programs. As a city, we must continue to provide safety-gap measures such as emergency rental housing assistance and rapid rehousing.    These programs and policies are essential to helping those at risk of homelessness. We must also continue to work toward the goal of closing DC General and moving to a smaller, District-wide shelter program, an initiative I not only supported, but championed in moving the Ward 6 short-term emergency family shelter forward. After initial neighborhood opposition to the Mayor's proposal, I led an effort that resulted in broad community support and the inclusion of a fully modernized health clinic for low-income residents. In addition, where some neighborhoods in the city have continued to fight the siting of a short-term housing facility, Ward 6 neighbors not only support the facility, but have advocated for greater density to ensure the project is successful.    While there are many ways to battle homelessness, I have advocated for two specific investments that I believe can make a significant difference in people's lives. First, I believe Permanent Supportive Housing is an approach that can help chronically homeless individuals stabilize and get needed wrap-around services. I want the District to invest more significantly in this critical effort. Second, I believe we must help residents before they lose their homes. I led a new effort to create a Civil Gideon for eviction proceedings - a right to legal counsel when facing evictions - that will address a huge imbalance in the courts. Nearly 90 percent of landlords are represented by an attorney, whereas nearly 90 percent of tenants are not. We therefore shouldn't be surprised by the outcome. As chair of the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, I was able to secure $4.5 million last year to fund the program that pairs residents facing eviction with a pro bono attorney to help them stay in their homes or reasonable transition to other stable housing - rather than face the immediacy and trauma of eviction for themselves and their families. These are just two of the ways I believe we can do more to address homelessness in the District."

      "question": "How would you support using the District's current budget surplus? If in the future the District falls into recession creating budget gaps in the $200-400 million range, what would you propose doing then?",
      "response": "Although the District ended Fiscal Year 2017 with an increase in the general fund balance, the vast majority of those funds were already obligated -- through the regular budget process -- as part of the Fiscal Year 2018 budget and financial plan. The remaining funds are tied to federally-required cash reserves and debt service reserves.     Best practices say the District should have savings available equal to the funds necessary to operate the government for 60 days. This “rainy day fund” approach is designed to ensure that the District can continue to operate in the event of an economic downturn, by providing a reserve to tap into if needed. The District dipped into our reserves during the government shutdown several years ago and also during the recession. We've seen economic growth over the past 10 years and have been steadily building up the reserves (currently at savings equivalent to 54 days) during that time. If there were an economic dip mid-year, without reserves to tap, the cuts we would need to make to balance the budget would be devastating. The rainy day fund would allow us to get through the year until we could right-size the overall budget through the regular budget process -- when we can hear from the public on our priorities."

      "question": "Are you committed to implementation of Vision Zero (zero traffic deaths)? What is the most important change to the roadways, law, or DOT practices that could bring about Vision Zero?",
      "response": "Yes, I am committed to the implementation – and expansion – of Vision Zero. In my campaign, I talk about Smarter Growth, and what that means today when looking at transportation policies. We have a historic imbalance in Montgomery County between investment in roads, and investment in mass transit. I believe we need to rebalance our investment, with a far greater focus on mass transit. New roads and added highway lanes are not a long-term answer – and in fact will add to the traffic deaths we have in Montgomery County.  I believe we can work towards Vision Zero through a variety of channels:   Reliable, accessible and speedier mass transit options (e.g., a reinvigorated RideOn bus service, with a wider BRT network) will reduce the number of personal cars on the road.   Dedicated and separate bicycle lanes and pedestrian walkways, paired with a robust education program for drivers, cyclists and walkers. Part of this will have to be stricter enforcement of automobile speeds and encroachment on cycling and walking lanes, as well as pedestrian safety. Too many people dash in front of cars mid-block, and too many cars ignore the “share the road” laws.  Data-driven intersection control to reduce congestion and traffic times.    Ultimately, we must begin to make our roadways “human-first” and not “auto-first.” That includes paying attention to crosswalk designs, broader sidewalks, speed limits, predictable road planning – but also a far more vigorous public campaign. We must do a better job of educating everyone who uses the roads on their responsibilities, so we cut down on driving while stoned, drunk, tired or texting, but also unsafe pedestrian and cycling habits as well as unsafe drivers.

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "For generations, Montgomery County treated road and highway planning as if the county were going to remain a bedroom community forever. Today, more of our residents live in the higher-density urban neighborhoods, but we are all still too reliant on personal automobiles. That's due in large part to the historic imbalance in funding favoring roadway expansion over mass transit projects. I believe we have an obligation to re-balance our priorities significantly, and that our public transportation projects require the majority of our funding. I would hit “pause” on any roadway expansion project in favor of ensuring that we first pay for our public mass transit projects. "

      "response": "Land-use issues are fast becoming social justice issues in Montgomery County, in light of the growing economic inequality in the county, and the lack of affordable housing. I believe it is imperative that we address that lack of affordable housing through many means, because it is at the cusp of becoming a very real crisis for many more families.

      "response": "First, let's recognize that there are areas of the county where there are simply no affordable housing units at all. We have a problem of growing income inequality in Montgomery County, and the lack of affordable housing is a symptom of that. There are communities that frankly use zoning rules to zero out any new housing development, particularly housing that would be affordable to middle-class and working-class families. So to begin to close the gap, we have to reduce restrictive zoning codes (delaying projects, or requiring off-street parking). We can increase the proportion of MPDU's required with every new project, up to 15 percent. We also should make sure we are maximizing the use of county owned land to produce more affordable housing options. I believe we can encourage higher-density projects with mixed-use space that would see developers actually want to build affordable housing because of the market demand – and the fact that the higher-density of units makes the project financially attractive to the builder."

I believe we are also not keeping that Promise to every county resident – and that's why I am running. The Silver Spring Library project is the perfect example of a great opportunity to meet several parts of the Promise – find a way to allow our aging neighbors the opportunity to retire in the community they helped build, while creating more affordable and accessible childcare and early childhood education centers.     The old Silver Spring library served generations of Montgomery County residents — including me. I believe I would have preferred to see the site redeveloped with an eye toward both the childcare and putting the senior housing in a walkable, Metro-accessible neighborhood. Today it appears the County has approved the Library site for the child care center, and has identified a White Oak location for a senior housing project of no less than 92 units."

      "response": "Part of the reason why I won the endorsement of the Sierra Club in this campaign is because I recognize how great a social justice land-use has become in Montgomery County, and how far we must go to draw our neighbors who are low-income or people of color into the environmental movement.     Every community has poor people and poor neighborhoods. But just because they are poor doesn't mean they should be unsafe. Being poor shouldn't mandate your home be adjacent to the “chain link fence” industries that bring noise, crime, traffic, and pollution. But our zoning, land-use and transportation decisions in this county are making that happen – and it is wrong. I will fight on behalf of people of color and low-income families – those communities that are most underrepresented in Montgomery County – to raise their voice, increase their civic engagement, and deliver that message.     I have a record in Montgomery County of working in underrepresented communities. As the son of an African immigrant, who grew up to a single mother in the Longbranch neighborhood of Silver Spring, I am intimately familiar with the challenges of being poor not being white. As counsel to U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, as special projects director for President Barack Obama, and as senior advisor to Education Secretary Arne Duncan, I have been in the midst of policy issues to help resolve these very problems. My experience ranges from the streets of Silver Spring to the corridors of the Capitol, and I have dedicated my life to addressing these wrongs. Today, I see that the greatest impact on the day-to-day lives of the people I care about most can be made from a seat at the Council table in Rockville.

As the most used bus transit corridor in the county, I am unconvinced that it could be successfully replicated beyond that road. I am not in favor of dedicated lanes at the expense of existing auto traffic lanes at this time.   While there is a great focus on and push for using mass transit, I'm not sure it exists where and when people want/need it.Transit options must be where people need to travel between, not necessarily where they currently exist. For instance, at an Upcounty Citizen's Advisory Board meeting, I learned there is no direct route between Damascus and Germantown. A rider would have to go all the way to the Shady Grove Metro and then take another bus back North. Bus rideshare startups like Bridj, Chariot, Loup, Leap, Midnight Express, and Blackline are the Uber for groups and may challenge our concept of traditional mass transit through crowdsharing."

      "response": "For Vision Zero to be successful, we must have a strong partnership with MDOT because so many of the roads in the county are maintained by MDOT. We will often need MDOT permission for placing Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons (HAWK signals) to ensure pedestrian safety at non-intersection crossings. These should also be well lit at night. Roads will be needed that support multiple modes of transportation – including walking, biking, and public transit – and infrastructure in place to assist seniors and people with mobility impairments or other disabilities. Separate bicycle lanes or paths, whether protected or not, and signal timings that allow pedestrians to cross without being too long to frustrate drivers will also provide protection.      In addition to the advertising on buses to remind drivers to watch for pedestrians, there must be a strong educational campaign for pedestrians to encourage safe, non-distracted road crossing. In other words, NOT midblock while wearing all black at night. The number of near misses I've encountered are too numerous to count and stop my heart every time. "

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "My #1 priority is improved, real-time traffic light signaling! Even if it yields only a small return on shorter travel times, people will feel better moving along at a faster pace and this will also cut down on vehicle emissions.     New, reversible lanes on I-270 will be necessary to reach Clarksburg and the growing upcounty region. This is the open green space in the County in which to build the single family homes that are always attractive to families.  The M83 right of way has been dedicated and would move local traffic through Montgomery Village to the Upcounty as a support to relieve I270 congestion.   BRT on Rt. 29 could move forward as planned. I am concerned about the timing that some station stop infrastructure may need to be redone in the future on account of the Purple Line. Again, I am skeptical about replicating BRT in other areas that do not already have that amount of existing ridership.   As I said previously, I'm not sure mass transit exists where and when people want/need it. Transit options must be where people need to travel between, not necessarily where they currently exist. Bus rideshare startups are the Uber for groups and may challenge our concept of traditional mass transit through crowd sharing.   Before greater investment in the existing transit options, we need better data. For example, recently a commuter questionnaire was distributed through Montgomery County businesses. This should have been sent to all residents━otherwise we are only capturing the commuter habits of those who work within the county. Many who live along the I-270 corridor commute to Northern Virginia, and many who live near Metro likely commute downtown. They are all commuters. Knowing their final destination would be the first step in understanding exactly WHAT is needed rather than only trying to enhance what already exists.   CCT is another project that I feel we need more reliable data before investing. There's a reason, other than lack of State funding support that it hasn't moved forward more quickly.   I do not believe MARC expansion would be a capital expense but rather reaching an agreement with CRX for greater frequency of service. Another consideration is that more frequent crossings of Randolph Road in Rockville and Summit Ave in Gaithersburg will incur more traffic flow interruptions and greater congestion locally.   I would not advance the Montrose Parkway East plan due to cost and not connecting to the existing parkway section.   Anything done to I495 MUST have comparable lanes on the Virginia side. I am not in favor of HOT lanes for this project. To double the capacity of the American Legion Bridge, I would look to double deck the bridge."

      "response": "Honestly, I'm not sure we will ever be able to entirely meet the need for low income housing. I'd be interested in exploring alternative housing options before streamlining the approval process.     I would not support reduced parking requirements as they currently exist. We have urbanized areas in the county, which are not a true city, and are still very much car dependent beyond immediate shopping and commuting needs. Travel to medical care and schools still mostly require a vehicle. As it is MARC parking is usually at Metro stations and therefore limited. One of the recurring questions I heard at BRT open houses was whether there would be parking available at the stops. Not in all cases. Which would put additional pressure on neighborhood parking. Limiting available parking would also limit or create additional pressure on dedicated handicapped parking. "

      "response": "The challenge of finding affordable housing is a perennial issue in the County. The increase in the Recordation Tax Premium in May 2016 helps low and moderate income households because half of those proceeds is for rent assistance for low- and moderate-income households. Additionally, the Subdivision Staging Policy (SSP) provides for 12.5% MPDUs in any new residential development of 20 units or more. Although there has been some discussion by Councilmembers to take that to 15%, I believe that should not be the standard countywide but reviewed during Preliminary Plan Approval process.     I have several years experience as the MCCPTA Capital Improvements Program (CIP) Committee chair. During that time, I helped school communities work with the planning departments of the Cities of Rockville and Gaithersburg. For at least 18 months, I directed an MCCPTA CIP subcommittee working extensively on the revision to the County SSP with the Parks and Planning staff, the Planning Board, County Councilmembers, and Council staff to address school overcrowding and increase school construction funding through impact taxes. Ensuring adherence to applicable Adequate Public Facilities Ordinances, especially regarding school capacity, was paramount. Student generation rates vary depending on the type and mix of housing in a Master Plan and the greatest increase in students comes from affordable housing units. We were also very attuned to the need for affordable housing while balancing affordability of living in a given neighborhood and the cost burden of MPDUs on a project and whether a height increase would be necessary to meet the required 12.5% minimum.     Building code and zoning ordinance changes should be explored to perhaps use office space differently. Dormitory style housing could be explored. Perhaps the answer lies immediately outside the county in Prince Georges County on account of the Purple Line putting Montgomery County within reach for employees.     The destruction of affordable housing for new projects is along the Purple Line will be a challenge. Displacing current residents in the name of progress concerns me. Perhaps there could be a way to grandfather in current residents at a lower rent in the new development and scale up rent increases over time by agreeing to a longer term lease. Finding nearby interim transitional housing during construction might be possible so that for families with school-age children, the students would be able to attend the same school."

Proximity to existing housing would make midrise housing stick out from its neighbors.      My general approach to new development and redevelopment projects is that everyone moves somewhere for a particular reason, I want to find out what that is and make it better! So let's ask! Rather than imposing the latest planning trend as the only formula for success to each area of the County, an approach that is more respective of a community's unique, evolving culture would be more appropriate. We should be meeting our residents' housing and shopping needs and recreational and cultural desires rather than prescribing what they will receive. "

      "response": "Often low-income and immigrant communities are under-represented. I feel this may be due to timing of meetings, usually in the evening, and at transit unfriendly locations. Language barriers are often an additional challenge. Finally the terminology used is not the easiest for most people to follow. A simple, clean presentation rather than gobs of technical details may make the experience more approachable for some folks who find the information overwhelming.     My advocacy on behalf of the underdog comes from my experience in MCCPTA leadership. Those areas without a voice for whatever reason needed to be represented regardless of their ability to actively participate in a meeting. I would make sure each of the 25 school clusters was represented (even if that meant I personally had to seek out their feedback) when it came time for testimony before the Board of Education and County Council. I also helped coordinate mentions of under-represented areas and schools needs by several other Cluster Coordinators in their testimony for greater emphasis.     Building on the tail end of my answer to #6 above, my role is to listen and then work to improve our County and our residents' quality of life. Honestly, we need to get out there and ask! Instead of mailers, library notices, and more websites, actual people need to be in the community, schools, business, and wherever people gather to find out the needs and desires of a community. I want to meet people where they are to hear them. I make a concerted effort to get out to community events large and small. I love to learn. Everyone and every community has a story. Most stories are unique, however when I begin to hear similar tales then I build coalitions with leaders in those communities for a greater voice and therefore a greater likelihood of action on an issue."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including at least $167 million from Maryland? How would you achieve this and what funds would you use? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "Yes. I would move to provide that quickly.  I would not require the changes in the board or labor agreements being discussed now, as these will not solve the numerous critical problems identified by the WMATA Inspector General, the National Transportation Safety Board and others. I would provide additional funding but in a manner that is subject to improvements based upon an independent review of the overall transportation network of which Metro is the core.  The review I would call for could be started now by the State Legislature, and if elected, I would press for a rapid yet thorough independent review of the State transportation system and budget. The review would examine how efficiently it interacts with the Greater Metropolitan Washington transportation network as well as the regional networks that connect our area with the surrounding states, the Boston-Washington Corridor and beyond.     Secretary Rahn admitted in a work session on December 5th that the funds offered by Governor Hogan do not exist.  He admitted that the Transportation Trust Fund of Maryland is tapped out, that is, fully committed already.  Secretary Rahn told legislators that the Governor expected to obtain the funds he offered from the Federal Infrastructure bill, that we now know is not likely to provide the level of federal or other investment needed both in our area and across the nation. Furthermore, as the needs increase, the Transportation Trust Fund has been declining for years due to more fuel-efficient vehicles and telecommuting, etc.  Therefore, any bonded or other committed or enforceable increase in funding now would come at the cost of other state services, non-specific tax increases, or a decline in state bond ratings, ultimately leading to higher costs for all state borrowing, unless we deal with this issue responsibly.    Therefore I would work with state legislators to name a review team of transportation, finance, economic development, environment and energy experts who also know the region to advise the legislature and the Executive Branch.  As Greater Washington has pointed out on its website, at least one class of the newer Metro-rail cars is requiring more electricity to run than expected.  This leads to not only higher costs but also more air pollution from the coal and natural gas fired power plants that provide most of the region's power.  We can do better and do it quickly by including all of the considerations that I cite in my answers here as applied to the work of ensuring high quality transportation and truly sustainable development.    In the meantime, in order to pay for the increases that WMATA needs, which are actually on the order of $25 Billion over the next ten years according to reports by both WMATA and the Council of Governments, I would take several steps.      I would press for legislation to create an independent commission akin to a Public Utility Commission but with more up to date standards and procedures to ensure that transportation services are fair, efficient, clean and safe.  This is essential if we are to be using long term contracts through Public Private Partnerships, which are one or more steps removed from direct responsibility to elected officials and the voters.  I would alter contracts that are not in the public interest, ensuring of course that neither the private partners nor affected residents experience any taking of property without due process or fair compensation.    I would ask the independent panel to study the success of some cities around the world to determine whether and at what rate to levy a modest fee on the developers and owners of land nearest transit stops to capture a portion of the profits derived from the publicly supported transit systems that draw so many to their properties.     I would support an increase in truck registration fees, to preferably be imposed in a uniform manner in the tri-state DMV area on heavy trucks, as they cause the greatest damage to the roads and tend to be the most highly polluting.    I would also support levying a state tax on non-renewable energy - related pollution at the most efficient point in the supply chain, such as on the generation or transmission utilities and wholesale fuel suppliers.     These fees and taxes could be phased in and then paid back out in part to residents of Maryland, as Maryland completes the process of ensuring a fully functioning transportation system using increasing percentages of renewable, clean energy and energy augmented by cyclists and pedestrians who should be provided with safe pathways and bike lanes that are convenient, quiet and shaded to the maximum extent possible.    I would also require that, as a condition for the continued payments but not a condition for the creation of the funding stream, rapid and lasting reforms in WMATA in order to correct the specific problems identified by the authorities noted above and by the independent review panel I would help create.  These reforms would need to be confirmed in WMATA's physical plant, management team, engineering and technological staff, training, deployment and rewards systems.     I would also require that the State and WMATA create a plan for the transportation of the future -- which is largely here now -- so that we do not invest in outdated technologies and instead take advantage of the modern mix of choices while ensuring the safety of all."

      "question": "Do you support Governor Hogan's proposed expansion of I-495, I-270, and/or the BW Parkway? Why or why not? With limited public funding, would you prioritize that, transit expansion like MARC, BRT, the Corridor Cities Transitway, Southern Maryland Rapid Transit, or other projects?",
      "response": "There is a great need for reducing traffic congestion but I do not support the expansion of the highway lanes in the manner that the Governor has proposed. There are better ways to solve the problem and to do so quickly.      That is why I would require a new transportation planning process and assessment of alternatives overall.      The first thing I would do is ensure that modern Transit System Management (TSM) and the interactive traffic signals and other systems it includes are in place on every state highway or road with any significant congestion.  The top ten such intersections in Montgomery County are north to south but the State rejected a Tiger Grant from the Federal Transit Administration for TSM on East to West routes near Washington and asked that it be reprogrammed to help renovate and expand a transit station that had gone over budget.    Once TSM is in place, we'll then need to expand clean, safe non-rail transit systems, which are much less capital intensive and more flexible in terms of routes and responding to ridership demand as it unfolds in the real world.  Then we'll need to carefully assess the alternatives for more expensive investments in all respects and there is a process for doing that right.  Key performance and financing considerations are included in the Federal Highway Act and related laws but they are not well enforced and are likely to be less well enforced as the Trump Administration proposes to waive or weaken Federal law in the Infrastructure bill.  That could result in massive spending on poorly planned projects.  The existing federal standards should be upheld and augmented by Maryland as we can afford the highest quality and we know how to achieve it without over-spending."

This specific accommodation is already required, in theory, in the Federal Transportation Departments' impact assessment orders that guide Federal subsidies for local transportation projects, but it is not well enforced.

I also support better and safer bike and pedestrian access across and under major roads such as Wisconsin Avenue.  In theory, federal law requires that bus routes serve as feeder routes to fixed guideway transit projects, and that they not see any reductions in service in order to pay for the new project.

I would support investment in transportation projects in order to ensure that we provide Amazon all the reasonable services -- including education, public safety, environmental quality and recreation as well as transportation  -- that they want in order to locate their HQ2 here.      On the other hand, our region's football team has not been a model of success or sustainability since the early 90's, and large scale taxpayer subsidization of professional athletic facilities should be closely scrutinized. It is not at all clear that such support would foster the economic development benefits that a new Amazon headquarters facility would.    Any public subsidies for professional sports venues should also require responsible improvements in safety and sustainability -- from stadium design to strong showing of the net environmental and economic benefits to the jurisdictions involved.  The DMV area -- acting together -- could be a leader in that as well.

      "question": "DC is amending its Comprehensive Plan. Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "Yes, I do support all three of those initiatives, adding housing to meet need, creating and preserving more affordable housing and strengthening protections for tenants in affordable housing being developed.  First of all, I believe we should be more aggressive and deliberate in using the District's Tax Incentive Financing (TIF) law to incentivize residential developers to voluntarily increase the percentage and level of affordability of affordable housing set asides in new and renovated projects.  As stated on the District's CFO webpages, \"Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is a program through which the District provides economic development project funds by borrowing against future tax receipts expected to be generated as a result of the construction and operation of projects partially funded by these funds.\"  TIF would be a good tool to employ to ensure that our affordable housing goals are embraced and supported by developers.  Second, I would evaluate current standards under the District's Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) program to ensure that 1) percentage of floor space set asides and 2) the definition of affordability in relation to the area Median Family Income are consistent with our aspirations as a city to address the affordable housing crisis.  If those standards are too low, I would advocate that we raise them as needed, keeping in mind that we don't want to stiffle reasonable development in the process.  Third, I would support legislation that grandfathers in protection for tenants who reside in affordable rental units so that they are not summarily displaced when their residential complexes are being redeveloped.  This last point is very important to me and raises concerns that go beyond economic development into the realm of human rights and the principle that Washington, DC, beyond the glitz and glamour of its facade as an international city, is first and foremost, a hometown for nearly three quarters of a million people and a tapestry of unique communities which each have their own distinct character.  In so far as the amendments to the Comprehensive Plan serve to preserve that character and expand housing for people from across the economic spectrum, I will support them."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "I do support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes with the caveat that the decisions as to where to place them should be made on a very local level.  I believe that just as the decision as to whether to grant a petition for the installation of Residential Parking Permit (RPP) signs requires the acquiescence of a majority of the residents of the affected block, any proposal to install dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes on residential streets should be subject to the informed scrutiny of the residents on the affected block.  This is particularly important where elderly or disabled residents exist.  I would not like to see dedicated bus lanes or protected bike lanes on blocks where elderly people live and where the homes they live in don't have garages or other forms of off street parking unless those residents have been informed in advance and have affirmatively given their consent to the installation of those lanes.  In newly developed communities, perhaps Planned Unit Developments, where the majority of residents are younger and less physically limited, my view is that dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes would make all the sense in the world.  First of all, PUDs usually have a certain amount of off street parking built in to their design.  Secondly, newer, younger residents are more apt to rides bikes and use public transportation.  Street parking is less important to those residents and providing more of it might encourage more automobiles, something that the District really doesn't need.  In either case, it is my position that the final decision to install or not install dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes should be made with maximum stakeholder engagement on the micro-local level.

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including $178 million from DC? How would you achieve this? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "As a native Washingtonian who has lived in this city almost all of my life (I did live in the Maryland suburbs for a year and a half when I was in my mid-30s) I believe that Metro has been one of most important success stories of the D.C. region.  Yes, I do support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro at the levels proposed in this question.  Traffic in D.C., and throughout the entire region for that matter, is almost unbearable at times.  But for Metro, our city would be in perpetual gridlock.  Metro helps to relieve some of the congestion on our streets.  Without it, D.C., in my opinion, would be unlivable.  We must fund Metro.  How to generate that funding is one of those \"devil is in the details\" considerations.  One possible mechanism is to access residential and commercial developers of large developments a kind of surcharge based on the anticipated volume of Metro use that the occupants of their developments will have.  In residential developments, for instance, there is a formula that developers use to estimate how many off street parking spaces need to be built into the design.  That estimate presumes that a certain percentage of residents will rely on public transportation.  The Metro surcharge could be based on the estimated percentage of residents who are likely to use public transportation.  The give and take would be \"Mr. Developer, you can save the cost of building parking garage spaces and use that space to build additional living space units to sell or rent if you pay a per resident surcharge to the Metro fund.\"  Depending on the numbers, paying the Metro fund surcharge may be less costly than building the off street parking and it would create a disincentive for purchasers of the residential units to own cars since there would be fewer places to park at their new homes.  Of course, we can and should also continue to lobby Congress to increase the federal Metro subsidy since the operations of the federal government depend on Washington's transportation infrastructure remaining functional.  As to other methods of achieving the needed dedicated, bonded funding for Metro, I will continue to think about this question and to research other options.  I'm sure there are many."

      "question": "Do you support funding the DC Streetcar to extend east to Benning Road Metro in Ward 7 and west in dedicated lanes to Georgetown? Or, what infrastructure to improve access by District residents to jobs, schools, and businesses would you support funding?",
      "response": "This is a tough one.  I can vaguely remember when D.C. had street cars.  In fact, for many years after the street cars gave way to gasoline powered buses in the early 1960s, streetcar tracks remained on our major thoroughfares.  So when I first heard of the coming new D.C. Streetcar, I was a little bit excited.   However, the roll out and financing of the plan to build the H Street line was grossly mismanaged.  Expanding the streetcar line, at this time, without addressing the issues that plagued its original roll out, would be throwing good money after bad.  I believe we need considerable stakeholder engagement before doing any further expansion.  While we secure that stakeholder engagement, we ought to secure dedicated, bonding funding for Metro, to make the system safer and more reliable and we need to repair our roadways.  Where appropriate, and with input from residents on the basic, micro-local level, we should install dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes and here's the third concept.  We need to step up enforcement of those dedicated and protected lanes.  Too many times, I've seen drivers totally ignore bus lane makings and drive though them past slower moving traffic, usually on their left.  I've also seen motorcylists and moped operators speeding through bike lanes to pass other motor vehicles.  To my understanding, bike lanes are supposed to be for non-motorized bicycles.  On the other hand, I have seen cyclists run red lights, cut dangerously across the paths of motorists and nearly knock down pedestrians.  They two should be subject to enforcement.   I don't know if stepping up enforcement with regard to dedicated lane use would require beefing up the traffic enforcement division of our Metropolitan Police Department but if that is the case, it seems to me that that might be a worthwhile investment of D.C. tax dollars which I would classify as an infrastructure improvement of sorts."

      "response": "I am very supportive of incentives to increase affordable housing so I can relate to Council Member Silverman's objection to the TIF funding of parking spaces at Union Market.  But, on a broader scale, I believe the Council made the right move in approving this particular subsidy.  It may be true that a majority of D.C. residents don't own cars but the reality is that Union Market, once completed and fully operational, will be a shopping destination for non-DC residents who will bring their dollars, including sales tax dollars, into the District.  It's only minutes by car from some of the most densely populated neighborhoods of Prince George's County, Maryland and not far from the Northern Virginia suburbs from whence come many of the daily commuters who work in our city.  Building adequate parking at Union Market will help draw that business into the District.  As always, I fully support stakeholder engagement in decision making on major projects that impact our residents like Union Market.  I'm not sure how much input was provided by residents in that community and how much great weight was afforded to the ANC but going forward, I would like to see that engagement increased.     "

Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "No, I do not think our historic preservation process is striking the right balance.  As I understand it, 90% to 95% of all historic preservation applications are approved, often without any meaningful input from affected neighbors.  I live very close to the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Ward 5.  In Bloomingdale, an application is pending to bring the whole neighborhood under historic preservation.  That application was filed without input from the residents of that community and, in fact, without advance knowledge on the part of most residents that it was going to be filed.  The filing of the application has generated a heated dispute among neighbors who have since organized a survey to determine what position the neighborhood wants to take, for or against the application.  Unfortunately, at this stage, there is considerable question as to whether whatever the neighborhood's position turns out to be will have any bearing on the final decision of the Historic Preservation Review Board.  That, in my opinion, is not right.  Make no mistake, I am in favor of honoring and preserving history and heritage.  Washington, DC, probably has more historic sites worthy of preservation than Boston, Chicago or Philadelphia.  But it's the process of historic preservation that I have grave concerns about.  I keep coming back to one of my favorite terms, \"stakeholder engagement\".  As much as in any other context, stakeholder engagement must be a vital part of the historic preservation process.  I would support changing the rules to accommodate that concern."

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "Income inequality in the District is a significant concern of mine.  As I see it, there are a number of root causes that we must get serious about addressing.      First off, we have to start educating our children to be prepared for the jobs of the future.  We have to end the destructive process of \"teaching to the test\", teaching children with the goal of getting them to score high enough on standardized tests to give the impression that our education system is working.  As has recently come to light in a series of disturbing news stories, we are pushing students to graduation without providing them with a true education.  After they graduate from high school they are ill prepared to succeed in college and they have no employable skills.  We need to reinstate vocational training in our public schools, and not woodshop, a class I took in Junior High School decades ago, but vocation training in the information technology field so students who don't off to college can find meaningful work in D.C. now in the 21st Century.  For those students who do opt for the college route, we need to be sure that when they graduate from high school they are prepare to compete in any college or university in this nation.  We need to make sure they are getting a well rounded education, including art, music, science, social sciences and financial literacy.  Education is the new currency of the 21st Century (a quote from radio personality Joe Madison).  Our young people need their fare share of that currency if they are going to lead our city in closing the income gap.           Second, we need to strengthen and enforce our First Source law.  There is too much development in our city for there to be so many unemployed residents.  Granted, part of the problem lies in the fact that too many of our residents don't have the skills or education to make them eligible for the high end jobs associated with such development.  Nevertheless, it is inexcusable that District residents are so poorly represented on construction projects, even, it appears, in so-called unskilled positions.  Perhaps a carrot and stick approach is needed.  We should penalize developers who skirt or First Source requirements but we should also incentivize those who go above and beyond it minimum requirements.    Third, we should consider the fact that part of our unemployment and underemployment problem stems from the fact that too many of our residents have permanent criminal records even though they may have paid their debt to society many years ago and lived a crime free life ever since.  D.C. has a law which provides for the sealing of criminal records but that law lists about 40 categories of criminal offenses which are ineligible for expungement or sealing no matter how long it has been since conviction.  Many of the crimes in those categories are for what most would consider rather minor offenses.  I believe we need to revisit that law and make it easier for persons who have made an honest effort at rehabilitation and kept their noses clean for a number of years to have their records sealed.  Ban the box legislation, which prohibits a prospective employer from inquiring about a job applicant's criminal record until a conditional offer of employment is made is not enough.  Citizens who have paid their debt to society and demonstrated good citizenship ought not be relegated to a state of permanent unemployability due to a mistake made years ago.    Fourth, we have to look closely at our minimum wage law (to make sure it provides for a livable minimum wage), parental leave, increased child care tax credits and other policies that help to prevent low income earnings from slipping into homelessness.  As quiet as it's kept, every homeless person is not unemployed.  We must have policies in place that ensure that every working person has the ability to obtain and maintain a safe place to call home.  That loops back into the topic of affordable housing but it incorporates a broader discussion of the social safety net and what role the District ought to play in that regard.    Finally, homelessness can stem from several root causes, chief among them unemployment, underemployment, and depression and other mental health issues.   We need to provide safe, clean shelters for the homeless.  It is a very sad commentary that some chronically homeless people would rather face extremely adverse conditions on the street than to go into District run or supported homeless shelters because of the realistic fear that in those shelters ,they might be assaulted, have their few possessions stolen, or both.   We must strengthen our outreach to the homeless community by making an effort to determine why they are on the streets and by providing mental health assistance where needed.  And we must ensure that people with mental health issues are identified and given the assistance they need rather than admitted into shelters where, without adequate support and supervision, they can pose a clear and present danger to themselves and others.  I believe that business and government partnerships and collaborations could be developed to address the problems of homelessness.  We should look closely at incentives that the District might provide to business to solicit their support in this important effort."

The high technology jobs like those in broadband is one way to bring stability to the housing market.  Second, we need more affordable housing and must capitalize on federal programs such as HUD's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC\").  This program provides tax credits for low-income earners and is particularly useful for certain public service employees such as teachers, public safety (police and fire) and veterans.  This program in conjunction with state and local County tax credits will be a great incentive to ensure affordable housing.  Finally, we must make good use of the foreclosure litigation settlement funds secured by former Attorney General Doug Gansler (and now current Attorney General Brian Frosh) to use settlement money to aid aggrieved homeowners and stabilize the housing market."

      "question": "Do you support Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) along U.S. 29, including the proposal to extend dedicated lanes south of New Hampshire Avenue into downtown Silver Spring, even if this means removing or narrowing general purpose lanes in some locations?",
      "response": "In answering this question, I assume the question refers to the Amendment to FY17-22, CIP, Facility Planning – Transportation to include US 29 Mobility and Reliability Study, which had a public hearing on February 27, 2018. I have served on the Route 29 South and Central Citizens Advisory Committee since its inception. Our first meeting was almost exactly three years ago, on February 28, 2015. The participants in the CAC have been working very hard to evaluate the various alternatives for improving mobility on the corridor.  From the beginning of the process, 6 options were considered, including median treatments.  This process included an evaluation by the County and State DOTs to evaluate which alternatives moved forward for detailed study based on the needs, goals and objectives of the project, including the study of dedicated lanes as the Council had also requested. This culminated in a decision by the County to refrain from median treatments, moving instead to engineer the County Executive's proposal to run the buses on the shoulder and in mixed traffic. We are now well past the 35% design stage after 3 years of work and construction is planned to start this year.  Ignoring three years of progress, we are presently completely reversing course by reconsidering placing the BRT in the median. Furthermore, this contradicts the CAC's unanimous call (and the facilitators' agreement) to put station stops on the curbside due to safety considerations; Four Corners has one of the highest number of annual pedestrian strikes of any intersection in the county.   This corridor already has very high bus ridership. I think a better alternative to the BRT on Route 29 is MetroExtra (limited stop service). Our CAC has asked repeatedly for this option in order to increase (the already very high) ridership on Route 29."

The most important change to the law that could bring about Vision Zero is stiffer penalties for distracted driving, so that offending drivers lose their licenses. Currently the law features insignificant fines for distracted driving that do not serve as enough of a deterrent. The penalties need to include license suspension and revocation when multiple infractions are recorded."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "I would prioritize the Midcounty Highway as first on the list of transportation projects because it has been on the master plan for many years. Residents moved into the upcounty area with the promise of this road and we need to build it in order to give the people the road that they need to get to where they need to go.    I think widening of the beltway and I-270 is a very expensive proposition, and consideration of this proposal will go on for years. In the interim, we should focus on reversible rush-hour toll lanes on I-270 as a way to help alleviate congestion on this road.

I am concerned that some naturally occurring affordable housing may be lost in redevelopment of certain areas so I would like to make sure that during redevelopment, those affordable units are replaced in kind.  The County should negotiate with developers, and work with the non-profit housing providers as well as the Housing Opportunities Commission. I am also concerned that much of the new development is for one bedroom units and there are not enough 3 bedroom units for families. Finally, there are currently 30,000 units approved and unbuilt in the pipeline. As the supply of residential units increases, we should see housing costs decrease."

      "response": "As I write this, the county has chosen a child development center for the site. I think this is a good result because of the site's proximity to Metro and access from behind the building for parents to use in dropping off/picking up children. This solution helps address our county's need for child care facilities for young children and in my opinion is a preferable solution to the competing senior housing alternative because the site would not be walkable for many seniors (i.e. it is too far from the shopping and entertainment district for seniors). I was happy to see the planned senior housing be relocated to Viva White Oak, because that would be more walkable for seniors.    In general, my approach to development and redevelopment projects is to recognize that no one solution is perfect, and there are always compromises and trade offs that must be made when a project is being considered (and a final selection is made). It is very important that these projects be evaluated through our standing process, so that voices both pro and against can be heard.     "

      "question": "Many Montgomery County candidates say they want to see more community engagement in land use and transportation decisions. Whose voices do you think are under-represented now, and why? What would you do to help those voices be heard?",
      "response": "I have testified in front of the Council many times on land use and transportation issues and I have yet to hear a person testify in a foreign language. I have seen people testify in a foreign language in front of the school board, but not in front of the Council. I think this is because people do not realize that planning and land use issues are a very large part of the Council's job and therefore the Council is very interested in hearing from residents on these issues. However, it tends to be the same residents, time and time again, who testify in front of the Council and whose voices are heard. Therefore, I would propose an “each one teach one” blue ribbon (unpaid) citizen advisory panel that would recruit testifiers from under-represented communities to come in and give their views to the Council. The very first underrepresented community I would recruit from would be the Latino community, because they are a very large group.     This plan would be as simple as finding interested parties, telling them when the meeting is, and making sure they show up to testify, then showing them where the room is, etc. We can advertise the Council meetings all we want but I know from personal experience that it is easier to go to one of these meetings when you have someone encouraging you to attend (and I am a native speaker of English, so it would be that much harder for those whose first language is not English).    I firmly believe that after a person has testified one time, they are likely to return to testify again, because they now understand the process, and they see that sitting down to give the testimony is actually not that intimidating.

      "response": "I do not support the proposed expansion of our highways. Experience teaches us that if you widen roads, you invite more cars. The expansion of I-270 was anticipated to relieve congestion for 20 years. In fact, increased traffic quickly filled up that extra capacity. Rather than spending our money on roads alone, we need to prioritize transit expansion in the means listed above, as well as the WMATA Priority Corridor System.

While many of the policies regarding planning, development, zoning, schools, and transit are county policies, the state can play a role by working with and supporting the county to ensure that transit-rich areas accommodate increased demand to live there. I would support enhanced state policies to promote the construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, affordable housing in transit-accessible areas. While the County's MPDU policy will help to drive some new affordable development in these areas, the state can play a key role through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.

I agree that the DMV should avoid a race to the bottom when it comes to a new NFL stadium. And while I support having Amazon HQ2 in our area, I am concerned at the level of incentives that are being thrown at it. We need to be responsible fiscal stewards and ensure that we do not give out more money than we bring in. Incentives, if any, must be tied to actual job creation and we must ensure that we do not give away so much in tax breaks that our priorities -- such as our schools -- cannot be funded."

The federal government should set the example for state and local governments by offering funding options (either through matching funding or grants) to states and cities that make concerted efforts to reduce traffic congestion and pollution through improvements that drive people to mass transit or bicycle transportation.

I support these as a method of funding when the government has taken the steps necessary to protect the public interests and when the financial risk does not fall completely on the tax-paying public.     I am opposed selling off infrastructure like airports, parkways and aqueducts to raise funds in the short-term. I believe that we can find a way to effectively fund and efficiently run these essential parts of our infrastructure, and selling them off for short-term gain is a foolhardy endeavor."

Every American should also be able to live in an area that offers economic opportunity, regardless of their education level or background. I believe that HUD should support programs that help to support access to this type of affordable housing, and that every effort should be made to support diverse, vibrant communities. To this end, I believe that the Housing Choice Voucher Program should be increased to offer more families the opportunity to receive support from the federal government so that paying rent does not become prohibitively expensive. Right now, local PHAs are forced to select from large pools of deserving families, and the method for selection is inconsistent across the country. By expanding the program, more individuals would be able to afford housing in areas that offer better economic opportunities.     In my district, this is extremely important given rate of growth and the cost of living. Too many families are being squeezed out of the district by ever-increasing rent costs, and they are in dire need of some form of relief."

      "response": "In VA10, the key to successful growth is going to be balancing the need for additional housing while maintaining the green space and parks that greatly improve our quality of life. First off, we need to ensure that there is a plan in place for how the district's infrastructure will grow in order to match the growth in population and housing. Part of this plan should include the construction of high-density, affordable housing near Metro and other public transit options. Having access to public transit is an absolute must for many people, especially in a district where such a high percentage commute to other locations for work. Affordable, high-density housing helps to maximize the number of people using public transportation while simultaneously giving people more economic opportunities.     I also feel that we need to make continued improvements to our roads and sidewalks that will allow people to bike or walk throughout the district. We should also look at options like express bus lanes that could help to reduce the number of cars on the road. By improving transportation options (both by vehicle and bike / foot), we will be able to improve the economic opportunities in areas that currently are not well served by public transportation options. This will allow for economic development in existing areas through the expansion or remodeling of existing commercial buildings."

In regards to funding the remaining portion (or going beyond the minimum recommended amount), I favor a statewide revenue source rather than a regional tax. Residents living in the DC Metro Area of Maryland pay gas taxes that fund projects in other parts of Maryland. I do not see why a double standard should be applied when it comes to fixing Metro. One possibility would be to follow what has been proposed in New York, which is a millionaires tax to fix the transit system. Maryland used to have this additional tax bracket, but it sunset.

      "response": "Yes.  I would take a different approach than being discussed in DC/VA/and MD.  I believe that six roads leading to DC should be made into HOV toll roads using EZ pass in the same manner as is used for the ICC and that funding be dedicated solely for WAMTA.

In any case, I think that the money that would be dedicated to creating additional lanes on these highways should be used, instead, to create suburban links between the Metro station (see below).

      "response": "Transit System:  The reason there is a Washington Area Metropolitan Transportation Authority is because there is a Washington area transportation problem.  The problem boiled down to its essence is: how do we get carbon-emitting, congestion-causing automobiles off of 495?  The ONLY way to do this is to invest in suburban-linkages between the suburban Metro stations:  Vienna-.Franconia/Alexandria->Branch Avenue->Largo->New Carrollton->Greenbelt->Wheaton->Grovesnor->Tysons Corner->Vienna.    To preserve and collect the needed capital for this massive transportation project we should coordinate with Arlington with respect to its planned gondola service to Georgetown and expand it up the Capital Crescent Trail, through the Georgetown Branch Trail and along what would have been the Purple Line route.  This would be an inexpensive and less-intrusive stop-gap measure until the New Carrollton-Greenbelt-Wheaton-Groversnor-Tysons Corner linkages could be established to provide real congestion relief to the Washington metropolitan area.

I generally support the ownership structure of The Green Bay Packers which, I understand, the NFL has banned through its internal rules.  I would ask the Maryland Congressional delegation to sponsor legislation in the Congress that would end the NFL's exemption from U.S. anti-trust laws unless the NFL consented to public ownership of its sports franchises.  If public ownership were reintroduced as a valid form of ownership in the NFL rules and if the Washington Redskins agreed to the sale of all of its shares to residents of DC, MD and/or VA (with the same general rules for the Redskins as are used for the ownership of The Green Bay Packers), then and only then would I allow public funds to be used in support of The Redskins."

      "response": "I support Transit Relief and the Governor's initiative to expand the mentioned roadways, particularly if a PPP is used which would offset the tax payer burden in lieu of giving up a portion of the revenue to a private entity for a fixed duration of time.  However, I am concerned that the focus on reducing traffic congestion “around” the city would impact the ability to reduce traffic congestion “within” the city. I am personally in support BRT and I believe a traffic study would justify its use in supporting a greater number of commuters traversing the roadways in shorter time periods. I just returned from Thailand and utilized this mode of transportation.  I found it extremely dependable with minimal delays on expected arrival time due to the dedicated right of way.  Again, I support this but would like to see this supported by traffic studies both inside and outside of the beltway with the projects prioritized based in which projects can provide the most relief at a cost that is sustainable by all jurisdictions concerned.

Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "Crafting stronger language for policy priorities into the Comprehensive Plan in support of equitable city-wide development, addressing housing affordability, resident displacement and strengthening tenants' rights is the right thing to do and appropriate to the amendment process. Yet the Comprehensive Plan alone does not create more housing, make housing more affordable, or protect tenants' rights -- but provides a planned framework and vision for the Washington we aspire to be.     To achieve these goals, we also have to make sure that our laws and regulations are similarly aligned with the Comprehensive Plan. Affordable housing requires supportive laws and zoning regulations. Two of the 64 amendments I submitted for consideration to the Comprehensive Plan addressed sustained home sharing (Tracking numbers 0006 & 0007). We need to balance the benefits of services like Airbnb with those of homeowner and tenant rights, which I'm convinced can coexist.     Adept use of preservation law can also balance the desire to have historic and architecturally distinctive neighborhoods while increasing housing choices for families of all incomes, which is a big issue in my Ward. My ability to use the Comprehensive Plan, zoning regulations and preservation law simultaneously has produced exciting outcomes. The Arcade-Sunshine Laundry, Avingnone Freres, and William Sidney Pittman's Trinity Church projects collectively create 329 new housing opportunities in Ward 1 by incorporating historic facades and buildings into new construction in a balanced way that did not require official landmark designations.     My approved landmark nomination of the former Hebrew Home building paired with a zoning map amendment creates 187 new apartments in the housing pipeline with 80% of the units being targeted at 60% AMI or lower including 90 senior apartments. And understanding the interrelationship between the Comprehensive Plan, zoning and the development history of Georgia Avenue paired with experience in the Planned Unit Development process contributed to bringing another 462 apartments into the housing pipeline in the Park Morton redevelopment project, preserving 147 public housing units and creating another 155 apartments that will be at 60% AMI or below (including 76 apartments for seniors).     All-in-all, my understanding of the intersections of the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning regulations, and preservation law -- and knowing when to use each -- has resulted in my influencing and advancing projects creating 978 new housing opportunities that serve the Ward 1 community. This includes preserving or creating 468 affordable units in the housing pipeline."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "Absolutely.    In March 2014, I advocated for expanding the Circulator Bus system to connect the Petworth/Park View area with Dupont Circle/K Street part of town. (see resolution here http://anc1a.org/Resolutions/2014/Circulator%20Resolution.pdf) I have and continue to be a strong supporter of creating and expanding a District-wide bike lane network, preferring protected bike lanes where possible. In July 2015, I introduced a resolution advocating that DPW maintain bike lanes in addition to parking lanes during street cleaning (see here: http://anc1a.org/Resolutions/2015/Bike%20Lane%20resolution.pdf) and in April 2016 I asked DDOT to conduct a  feasibility study to create protected bike lanes on Park Place, NW (see here http://anc1a.org/Resolutions/2016/Park%20Place%20Traffic%20Study%20Resolution%20OCI.pdf). Due to the difficulty of balancing transportation priorities, use of public space, and funding none of these have been accomplished to date. None-the-less, the advocacy does help and better informs DDOT in their planning process.    We want reliable transportation whether we drive, walk, bike, or take metro or the bus. We need the right balance to make them all work –  including parking. Having actively participated in DDOT's east-west crosstown study, I know that trade-offs must be made. While I'm on record as wanting dedicated bike lanes on Park Place, one place I would like to see dedicated bus lanes considered is Georgia Avenue – and on every route where the Streetcar is being considered.     Dedicated lanes would not make sense on corridors like Sherman Avenue unless the raised center median were removed. While the raised median is nice, it limits the efficient flow of traffic on a regular enough basis that in 2015 WMATA considered rerouting the 63 & 64 bus routes to 11th Street. I strongly advocated that WMATA not reroute the Sherman Avenue buses and they still operate on Sherman Avenue today.    I would like to see the new 59 limited-stop bus on 14th Street extended to National Airport. It cuts through many neighborhoods without good access to Metrorail. Even when Metro is performing well, easy access to our airports will always be a great asset."

Rather than just provide enough funding to keep Metro on life support, I heartily endorse dedicated, bondable funding. We need to undo the damage of decades of deferred maintenance, improve the system with better infrastructure, new rail cars, and new connections between stations.

      "question": "Last year, the DC Council approved $36 million in tax-increment financing to subsidize 600 additional parking spaces at Union Market. Are you supportive of the way that TIF proceeded or would you like to see changes for future TIFs, regarding parking and/or in general?",
      "response": "Tax-increment financing is an excellent tool for leveraging future expected tax revenue increases to reinvest into our communities. I support the Council's decision to use this tool for Union Market. Of the $82 million TIF, $36 million is to fund parking for the market. This part was controversial in part because the Chief Financial Officer testified that the TIF was not necessary for this development. With this in mind, the amendment proposing to use $18 million of the TIF funds for affordable housing was a good idea which I would have liked to have seen more support from members of the Council.     I know many advocated for TIF money to be redirected from additional parking spaces to be used for a new entrance for the NoMa Metro Station to improve access to Union Market. While a new NoMa entrance is an excellent idea and a goal I fully support, it isn't legally possible to use the Union Market TIF in this way as the station falls outside of the geographic boundaries defined in law by the TIF.      Closer to home, I would advocate for the District to consider Neighborhood TIFs in Ward 1, especially in areas like Columbia Heights and lower Georgia Avenue. Both have newly established Main Street organizations that would benefit from a reliable revenue stream, allowing them to do more for our neighborhoods and small businesses, as I expressed in my Letter of Support for District Bridges Main Street application (see letter here: http://www.boese2018.com/sites/kentboese/files/Georgia%20Ave%20Main%20Street%20Recommendation%20Corrected.pdf )"

      "question": "Nearly 20 percent of all property in DC is protected by historic preservation law - more than Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia combined. Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "I've successfully worked with developers and the District to preserve the most important character-defining features of historic buildings in our ever-changing city, with 12 successful historic landmark nominations that were approved by the HPRB to my credit. I believe these make our City stronger. I've also worked collaboratively to repurpose structures without designating buildings as historic (e.g. Alsco-Linens of the Week. and Morton Street Mews).     In the case of the Hebrew Home for the Aged, having the vision to protect the historic building years before development occurred resulted in more community support to develop the property, putting 187 new residences in the new housing pipeline, with 80% at substantially below market rents, including 90 apartments for seniors. I have never or would I ever support using DC's preservation law to stop development.    DC's preservation law is not incompatible with the needs of a dynamic city. Nor is it my opinion that it significantly excludes potential residents. But two things are needed:  ●\\tThoughtful members of the Historic Preservation Review Board; and  ●\\tDC Council members who are willing to pass legislation that gives residents additional options than currently exist.    While one or two members of the Council today understand the value of preservation, we currently do not have a single Councilmember working on legislation that would help balance the values of preservation, development, and growth. This is especially true in Ward 1.    Ward 1 has some of the oldest and densest neighborhoods in DC. We frequently need to find consensus when competing values come into conflict. The present hands-off approach (e.g. Sun Trust Plaza debate) has hindered progress rather than lead to desired outcomes.     I am a strong advocate for the creation of Conservation Districts (aka Legacy Districts) – a choice where neighborhoods could embrace the general architectural character of their community without the detailed review for window replacements and smaller projects that some consider to be expensive and overly burdensome. I urged the Office of Planning and DC Council to introduce and pass legislation to do so in October 2014. While draft legislation existed, neither the Office of Planning or DC Council acted.    (Link to my 2014 resolution asking for conservation districts here: http://anc1a.org/Resolutions/2014/Conservation%20District%20Resolution.pdf)    Our process needs to focus on “How” to construct new buildings and expand existing housing in century-old neighborhoods, not a binary “yes” or “no”."

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "Income inequality in the District is constantly cited as being the highest in the United States. Equally alarming, the District has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. 26.7% of children in the District are living in poverty, and the percentage in Ward 1 is 21%. This all has a negative impact on education and the achievement gap, thus creating a cycle of poverty that is difficult, if not impossible, to break.    We need to do more to invest in affordable housing, including increasing Permanent Supportive Housing facilities for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. I support Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1B's ability to work with the City at Ward 1's Rita Bright Youth Center. The proposal is to build thirty-five units of short-term housing for homeless families and 15 units of permanent supportive senior housing where a surface parking lot currently exists.     We have many other opportunities throughout the District where this approach could be replicated.     ●\\tWe need a survey of District-owned property that is currently underbuilt and could support housing co-located on the site. Examples in Ward 1 include Engine Company No. 9 on U street and the 3rd District Police Station on V Street -- both are one to two story buildings in an area zoned for 50ft. tall mixed use structures. We need to leverage properties like these for the additional stories and opportunities they can provide.  ●\\tSROs like La Casa that can be used to keep individuals from becoming homeless, and as a first step to permanent housing for those that were homeless.  ●\\tMany new housing projects should include the opportunity for some residents to have an equity stake in the project (rent to own units, in addition to those set aside as affordable rental options)  ●\\tCouncilmember Robert White introduced legislation to grant a tax credit for businesses hiring residents that have been unemployed for 27 weeks, and the District is offering Amazon $7,500 relocation assistance per employee, why not offer a $5,000 tax credit for hiring District residents that offsets the cost of Paid Family Leave and an increased minimum wage? Why not make District residents a truly valued commodity for employers?    A focus on equitable development is also necessary. I'm proud of the work I've put in to rebuilding the Park Morton public housing complex and its preservation of the 147 low-income apartments. This effort will also create 155 new housing opportunities for working families and housing for seniors. But even with a guarantee that Park Morton residents have a right to stay, not all residents may choose to do so.    No city has succeeded at producing enough below-market housing for those who need it. We need a stronger commitment to adult education, especially vocational, paired with jobs so our residents can afford to stay.  I support programs like Youth Build which does just that.    Additionally, we need to take steps to grow small businesses and the jobs they create to increase the employment prospects of families that struggle the hardest to make ends meet."

      "question": "How would you support using the District's current budget surplus? If in the future the District falls into recession creating budget gaps in the $200-400 million range, what would you propose doing then?",
      "response": "Easy: invest in infrastructure. I'd start by replacing lead water service lines -- all the way to the house.  Currently, DC Water only replaces lead service lines up to the private property line -- the section on private property must be funded by the owner. This is unacceptable.    I was initially encouraged when I learned that a bill was in the works in 2017 to address this issue. Upon seeing the bill, I was deeply disappointed by its failure to actually address the problem. As introduced, at best it only brings back an old idea of providing grants to low income families who wish to replace lead lines on private property. I believe we can do better, and no amount of lead in our water system is acceptable.     In December 2017 I introduced a resolution from ANC1A advocating for full lead line replacement across the entire District. The resolution passed unanimously. I sent copies of the resolution to every single Councilmember advocating for them to take action. Councilmember Cheh's office was the only Councilmember to respond.    (Link to resolution here: http://anc1a.org/Resolutions/2017/12_2017%20Full%20Lead%20Service%20Lines%20Replacement%20Resolution.pdf )    Following this, I met on January 5, 2018 with a member of Councilmember Cheh's Committee on Transportation and the Environment to discuss this issue in depth.  Based on that conversation and subsequent communications I believe there will be significant improvements in the final bill when the full Council eventually considers it.       My approach to the budget -- in good times and bad -- will always be focused on where our money can do the most good for the greatest number of people. We need to look for efficiencies and eliminating government waste today, so that we have the money we'll need when less prosperous times arrive."

      "question": "Prince George's County is the most dangerous in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. Why do you think this is? Is there a role for you in changing this?",
      "response": "Pedestrian and bicyclists' safety has not been treated as the public health crisis that it is. A lack of sidewalks and unprotected crosswalks -- or no crosswalks at all where people need to cross a busy street --  has led to our residents being at unnecessary risk of death or serious injury.  We've prioritized putting extra safety measures in place on Route 1 in College Park, where students' being hit makes the news. But on East West Highway, and in Riverdale Park on Kenilworth Avenue, the largely immigrant population is forced to dodge many lanes of traffic when crossing the street. One crosswalk there has had multiple deaths, because it has no traffic light.     As a Delegate in the Maryland General Assembly I advocated -- and got -- countdown walk lights installed at several traffic lights that helps pedestrians and cyclists cross more safely. There are crosswalks that I have been thus far unsuccessful at having traffic lights added, which has been a source of frustration.     Public officials have a clear role in crafting policies that integrate the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists, making sure that bike lanes are created and protected, as well as installing sidewalks and safe crosswalks. We need crosswalks where people need and want to cross, with traffic lights that can be prompted to turn red when needed for those crossing on foot or on wheels. If we are to build walkable, sustainable, and safe communities, more attention and long-term planning for pedestrians and bicyclists will be necessary."

I encouraged and worked with our delegation to get behind this effort, sorely needed, regardless of where each of our districts were. I support extending The Bus service in all areas of the County.     It is important to have public transit available when and where it is needed. The county has been too dependent on a car-centric mindset and car-centric development in the past.

      "response": "Our top economic development priority needs to be jobs; to work for just and sustainable growth that will enable our citizens to earn a livable wage, to be able to work and live in dignity. To achieve this top economic priority, many things will need to be done. I will work toward the following:    - job creation through wise and sustainable long-term approaches, with prudent and transparent use of subsidies and incentives;    - make decisions with an eye towards increasing the county's tax base;    - repeal archaic laws or regulations that impair smart growth or limit desired growth (i.e. certain liquor laws);    - work to see that the permitting process is as quick, easy, and transparent as possible, and competitive with or better than other jurisdictions in the region. An unnecessarily cumbersome and complex permitting process hurts economic development and job creation, which ultimately hurts everyone in the county (and not just those seeking the permits);    - the zoning code rewrite will have important consequences; the council needs continuing oversight to address any unintended consequences that will inevitably emerge, and to work to make sure it is accomplishing what it intended to do."

      "question": "The county is currently developing a Comprehensive Housing Strategy. What are your goals and priorities for that? How would you combat the problems of evictions and foreclosures?",
      "response": "1) The long-term solution to creating desirable and affordable housing is to plan ahead, and ensure that our inevitable future growth is not sprawl, is located wisely, and does not exacerbate our current problems. Future growth should be aimed to revitalize and develop older, inside-the-beltway communities, with the idea of concentrating development and growth around Metro and Marc trains, and efficient bus routes. By the use of zoning laws, permitting decisions, and prudent and transparent incentives and subsidies, future development should incorporate the benefits of density and be oriented to ensure that truly walkable communities emerge, with jobs and amenities, and with the serious encouragement of safe, protected bicycle use.    There are 15 Metro stations in Prince George's County and multiple MARC stations, and the land around them has not been fully realized. As many millennials are priced out of housing in the District, farsighted decisions and planning will enable Prince George's to benefit. New apartment buildings need to offer amenities and appeal beyond the 20th century model. There is a tremendous opportunity, and well-planned housing and development is key.     The 20th Century is over; we need to move beyond the old car-centric approach to development. The county's housing, transportation, sprawl, and development problems are really a series of interlocking problems that need to be addressed in a holistic way, and not as discrete, unrelated problems.    2) The Prince George's County Department of Social Services currently has a program that provides information, assistance, and referrals to county residents who are facing foreclosure or an eviction. It is vital that the program be fully funded, and functioning as intended. It is important that people who may be suffering a temporary setback or short-term unemployment not lose their homes because of it, and compound a temporary problem into a long-term one."

Do you support including or removing \"election\" in the final zoning code?",
      "response": "I agree with the 2015 Maryland court of appeals decision on this issue, and agree that the county council should “. . . only reverse the action of the Planning Board if the Planning Board's decision is not supported by substantial evidence, is arbitrary and capricious, or is predicated on an error of law.” Prince George's County has a painful history of “pay-to-play,” and I support the reforms necessary to eliminate this stain. This includes not allowing the council, for arbitrary or personal reasons, having a second bite at the apple.    It is appropriate that the county council have recourse and final say in the event of an unusually contentious or controversial decision, or one where there is substantial evidence of a mistaken decision. But it is important that the council respect and adhere to the established process, and not return to the days of questionable second-guessing by the council."

Allowing ADUs would have multiple benefits for the county as a whole as well as for individual neighborhoods. The council should allow by-right ADUs in the eight regional transit districts (subject to specific code compliance), and for different reasons, be open to them elsewhere. In addition to increasing the availability of affordable housing, it would increase density in the transit zones and allow growth without the need for more cars on the road."

This must be a multi-prong approach with an emphasis on expanding the Train systems and bus services. Prince George's County already has plans to expand the Route 5 Corridor that leads to Brandywine; special attention should be given to these routes as there is already congestion in this location."

      "question": "DC is amending its Comprehensive Plan. Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "I absolutely support adding housing in all parts of the District. We cannot continue to build large, isolated housing complexes. Housing is only truly affordable when it is easily accessible to jobs, schools, daycare, supermarkets, hospitals or other health facilities, commercial services, public transportation, and green space. If housing is placed away from such essentials, the residents must spend considerable time and resources gaining access to them. As the pipeline sites continue to develop and the large sites become accounted for, we need to ensure that these areas are being developed in ways in which residents do not have to spend time and resources finding employment, education, and food. However, this also means we need to find ways to create more housing on infill sites.    This also means that we must create more housing throughout the District. Of course, we should seek to build on the approximately 426 aces of residentially zoned vacant sites. However, we should also spend significant energy creating more housing on the approximately 849 acres of underutilized sites. This is an astonishing number. DC now has approximately 2.5 times the number of underutilized acres than before. Since these sites are all privately owned, there is incentive for the owners to build their properties to full capacity. Bringing these sites to capacity will also create new housing in desirable, centrally located areas. Most of these sites are contained within or around mixed-use corridors, which means the essential services are already nearby. I am encouraged to see the proposed amendments to the Framework Element puts considerable focus on underutilized sites.    Also, along similar lines, there are many large, older homes in the District. Although the District should in no way force owners to take any action to these properties, there should at least be discussions about how the District may incentivize owners to redevelop some of these homes into smaller units. As we know, more and more people are looking to smaller, simpler living. As this trend continues (which it looks like it will), we should look for ways to transform our larger single-family homes to smaller, multi-family homes without endangering the character of our neighborhoods.    As more housing continues to be developed or redeveloped, our residents will start to see housing become more affordable. One of the best protections for tenants is a larger supply of housing. Although we do not want significant numbers of residents losing their housing because of redevelopment, we also do not want to put such burdensome safeguards in place that will limit or prevent redevelopment from taking place. To create a workable balance, transparency is the best policy. We should ensure that no resident is blindsided by their landlords. We should also ensure tenants have sufficient notice of any changes well in advance of such changes taking effect. Many of these protections are already written into the law; however, we need ensure they are being enforced."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "Yes, I support protected bike lanes. Conventional and buffered bike lanes are unsafe and simply do not work. Because they usually do not have a physical barrier, conventional and buffered bike lanes often are filled with parked vehicles, ride-hailing vehicles (taxis, Uber, Lyft) picking up or dropping off customers, or cars turning or passing other vehicles. Such obstructions are unsafe for everyone on the street, whether on a bike, in a car, or walking.    Although dedicated bus lanes have their advantages, I question whether busses will continue to be an effective and low-cost mode of travel. With Uber and Lyft piloting new services that appear to be like on-demand bus services, will traditional bus routes still exist in 10 years? If they cease to exist, the cost of creating dedicated lanes today will be wasted. This does not mean I oppose them, it just means I believe we need to have a larger conversation about the future of travel. Also, with decreasing costs associated with ride-sharing services and the always rising bus fares, we may end up in a situation where the ride-sharing services cost less than buses.    This leads me to the issue of on-street parking. As ride-sharing services become more popular, do we need as many on-street parking spots? Often, those cars sit in the spots for hours without moving. This is especially true these days with the ability to pay parking meters remotely. So, how many people benefit from such parking? I therefore would like to see more discussions about creating dedicated areas for ride-hailing services. Such areas could include dedicated parking spots as currently is being piloted in Dupont Circle, dedicated pick-up/drop-off zones as being tested in San Francisco, or maybe even separate lanes as you see at most airports around the country. This would help alleviate issues such as blocked traffic, bike lanes, and entrances. It would also decrease the number of car-hailing passengers getting out in the middle of traffic. Similarly, as less and less people own cars, we should think about whether there will be a demand for on-street parking 5, 10, or 15 years from now.    Regardless of these important conversations, I would like to see dedicated bike lanes on I Street from New Jersey Avenue, SE to 7th Street SW; M Street from 8th Street, SE to Maine Avenue, SW; 7th Street from Maine Avenue, SW to Florida Avenue, NW; and K Street from 7th Street, NW to 12th Street NE."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated, bondable funding for Metro totaling at least $500 million a year including $178 million from DC? How would you achieve this? Do you require other steps (governance, labor, etc.) before you can support it?",
      "response": "Of course, Metro needs the money. However, before we provide dedicated funding (which I support in principle), we need to take a hard look at what Metro is doing to prepare for the future.    Its undisputed that ridership is down. Why is that? Is it because of a lack of confidence in the system or because it is an outdated model? Are more people living farther from a metro station? If so, are they finding ways to get to the Metro or finding other ways to commute? I have not seen serious discussions about these issues. Instead, it appears all discussions revolve around “if you fix it, they will come.” But, is that true?    With ride-sharing services becoming more prevalent, Metro should find ways to work with them and not against them. For example, individuals use ride-sharing services to get to/from metro stations. So, Metro should partner with these services to allow for transfer discounts like there is for Bus to Rail transfers. This could also be the case with individuals who use a bikeshare service to get to/from a metro station. Similarly, Metro should also evaluate whether parking facilities are the best use of land. For example, could some land be sold or leased to house retail? Also, instead of parking lots, should some of the land be converted to designated ride-hailing space? These are some questions I would need answered before supporting dedicated funding.    In addition, Metro should look to LA Metro and its “microtransit” program, which basically provides on-demand public transit. In short, we need to ensure that Metro is not just trying to maintain its system but that is also looking to the future. If it's not, the dedicated funding will solve a problem now but will not set Metro up to be successful in the years ahead. "

      "question": "Do you support funding the DC Streetcar to extend east to Benning Road Metro in Ward 7 and west in dedicated lanes to Georgetown? Or, what infrastructure to improve access by District residents to jobs, schools, and businesses would you support funding?",
      "response": "I am interested in learning why ridership numbers appear to have peaked in October 2017 and have been decreasing since. Nonetheless, DC Streetcar's 1,203 riders per mile is almost in the top 15 of systems around the country. This number would presumably be higher if the system was more complete. I would therefore support funding to extend the streetcar east to Benning Road Metro. Such an extension would connect neighborhoods east of the river with the growing H Street Corridor and Union Station. This would not only allow residents from Ward 7 easier access to downtown DC but it would also make it easier for residents to travel east of the river. Such access would also hopefully increase commercial development on Benning Road.    I am less certain about extending the streetcar to Georgetown. Besides the fact that residents and businesses are more generally opposed to this extension, there also isn't as much of a shortage of transportation options to travel between Union Station and Georgetown. I would rather see the money spent extending the streetcar North-South. Such an extension could be the entire Takoma to Buzzard Point line as proposed or one more limited between Shaw (the convention center) and the Southwest Waterfront."

      "response": "When questioned about why the 600 additional parking spaces were subsidized, a common response was “this is how we always do it.” Such reasoning is extremely shortsighted. Besides the fact that the Office of Planning did not believe an additional 600 parking spots was necessary, we should be thinking about and planning for the future. We should be focused on more than just a drive-and-park mode of travel. We should be exploring options to accommodate and improve other modes, including public transit, walking, biking, and ride-sharing.    With DC becoming more bike-friendly, we should ensure there is enough bike parking or storage space. This includes both bikeshares as well as personally owned bikes. Riders should not have to leave their bikes in the middle of a sidewalk or chained to a utility pole or fence. Similarly, the sidewalks must be in not only good condition but also clean if we want to encourage residents and visitors to walk to their destinations. For example, the sidewalks around Union market are broken and filthy. Using the TIF to improve the pedestrian ways would have been better spent than more parking spots.    In addition, using a car-hailing service around Union Market is dangerous. There are no good places for the cars to drop-off/pick-up passengers. Instead of seeing the TIF used to subsidize parking spots, I would have liked to see the money used towards dedicated car-hailing zone. Like many of my answers to this questionnaire, I believe we must be looking into the future and planning accordingly."

Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",

We need to ensure that the designation is not being used to prevent necessary and important development or even redevelopment. This is especially true in historic districts.     With over 30 local neighborhoods having the historic district label, it is important to determine whether the regulations are creating underutilized sites. If so, we must change the system. Taken to the extreme, every neighborhood could become a historic district and limit redevelopment. If that happens, there will be less housing supply, demand will go up, and we will never come close to solving the affordable housing crisis.    We must therefore look for ways to reach middle ground. We must allow for development and redevelopment to take place while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods. In theory, the historic preservation law is a good idea; however, we need to ensure all stakeholders are aware of the process, are part of the process, and can live with the outcome of the process.

      "response": "The best way to close this gap is to ensure all residents receive the education necessary to enter the workforce. This includes not only our children but also our adults. Over the past few years, charter schools have helped with the cause. However, charter schools alone cannot fix the problem. For those who have already left educational institutions, we need to strengthen and expand our apprenticeship program. Not only will an expended program allow DC residents to enter high-demand industries, but it will provide our businesses with dedicated, hardworking residents who are committed to not only better themselves but the work they are doing.    We also need to support our not-for-profit communities better. There are great programs in DC that help individuals prepare for and find full-time employment. For example, Byte Back provides adults with computer training necessary for most office-based jobs. Similarly, Streetwise Partners helps adults learn the soft skills necessary to find and maintain employment, such as networking, resume writing, and interviewing. The District should work with these non-profits to allow them to continue to flourish and provide training to more residents.    With respect to the District's children, we must ensure that they graduate high school prepared for college or a career. Whether it's a neighborhood high school, a charter high school, or a career and technical high school, the District needs to ensure the school is truly working for the students and preparing them for their futures. Unfortunately, it appears some high schools in the District have failed at this basic premise.    In addition, the District must take a more holistic approach to support residents experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. Simply providing individuals with housing does not solve the problem. We must also provide them access to the resources necessary to succeed, such as education, healthcare, and mental health services. The District also must ensure residents are placed in housing that allows for easy access to necessary services, such as daycare, grocery stores, and public transportation. In addition, we should not be spending tens of millions of dollars placing homeless families in hotels/motels. The District must invest in creating housing options that will lead to permanent housing. Ideally, communities would be created that would allow for housing, education and training, and health services to be all connected and accessible. For example, the District could create an affordable housing village, which could consist of one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, preschool and daycare services on site, healthcare providers, a charter or technical and career school, as well as a grocery store and other retail stores."

      "response": "I do not find this plan feasible.  It would require houses to be torn down, the merger of lanes near overpasses, and there would be a great likelihood that tolls would be significantly too high for almost all Maryland residents, much like many commuters and drivers are experiencing with the I-66 tolls in Northern Virginia.  The Council's plan of utilizing reversible lanes makes sense, and smaller changes could also make sense including adding more entryways onto the main highway from the local lanes, and working with law enforcement to find a solution to rubbernecking after accidents.  CCT and M-83 are other projects incredibly important to the residents of District 15."

      "response": "The state should certainly encourage businesses to open or relocate and residential dwellings to be built around new transit projects.  This is not only wise for the economy, but also for the environment.      I believe the best way for our state to keep housing affordable for all residents is to raise wages.  Montgomery County already raised the minimum wage but the state should follow the county's lead and also increase the living wage along with it.  Requiring companies to file proof of providing equal pay for equal work with the state is a way to help ensure that wages would be increased.  Additional affordable housing measures will also likely be necessary as any minimum wage hike, albeit a step in the right direction, will not in and of itself prove sufficient in addressing this issue given the high property values throughout Montgomery County.

Whatever is politically feasible I would support. As a progressive, my preferred funding method would be some type of a surcharge on high income earners or a carbon tax on transportation fuels (i.e. gasoline and diesel). So as to lessen burden on local taxpayers, at least a portion of the funds could be raised through increased hospitality/hotel taxes. While it would not be my first choice, I would also support a dedicated sales tax increase for this purpose, if it turns out to be the most feasible option politically. I would certainly push for better governance of Metro, but is should not be a precondition for additional funding."

Transit expansion projects are a higher priority for me, as I believe they are more cost effective solutions to our long-term challenges.

      "response": "Yes by all means, I testified several times to WMATA on this issue. Here is a selection from my testimony given on January 31, 2018:  “Dedicated funding for WMATA should come from the taxation of regional wealthy residents, commercial property benefitting from WMATA proximity and regional corporate profits…  The WMATA Board should recommend to the governments of its jurisdiction serious consideration of the following progressive approaches to dedicated funding of the WMATA system:    1) Taxation of regional wealthy residents     In 2015, the most recent data available, DC returns with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) of $1 million and above had a taxable income of $5.39 billion, while for the same top income bracket MD had a taxable income of $18.13 billion and VA $24.71 billion (1).  For the WMATA region the total tax income of these millionaires was $48.2 billion, now likely even higher. A 1% tax on regional millionaire income alone would generate $482 million!      For residents with AGI $200 thousand and above the total taxable income was $12.8 billion in DC, $61.02 billion in MD and $83.4 billion in VA, giving a total taxable income of $157.2 billion. A 1.1 % surtax on this income would generate $1.8 billion equal to the proposed FY 2019 budget funding from state and local sources.  Note that the new federal income tax legislation in 2019 gives these wealthy taxpayers an average tax cut amounting to 1.2 to 3.4 % of their pre-tax income (2), more than a modest 1.1 % surtax that would deliver the total proposed state and local funds amounting to $1.8 billion corresponding to the FY 2019 budget. In addition, DC, MD and VA could generate significant additional revenue by simply recovering the remaining federal tax cut for these wealthy residents, leaving them with the same overall tax burden, state and federal, as if no changes occurred in the tax codes. For example, in 2019 DC could likely gain $300 million in more revenue, badly needed for housing and income support for low-income residents, by just hiking the DC income tax payments from the wealthy by 2%.     Thus , I urge DC, VA and MD to consider raising their state income rate on wealthy residents, especially millionaires, leaving them with the same overall tax liability, a step to making DC, MD and VA's tax structures more progressive, based on ability to pay. Note that Massachusetts has considered a 4% surtax on millionaire income to be spent on transportation and education (3) Likewise voters in the November 2016 election approved tax hikes on the rich in California and Maine (4).     2) Revenue from taxing commercial property benefiting from WMATA proximity  This case has been eloquently made by Rick Rybeck (5) and his dad, Walter Rybeck (6):  “It is very sad that WMATA is pleading poverty while it is giving away billions of dollars in Metro-created land values. (Metrorail cost about $10 billion to build, but has created more than $10 billion in additional land value around its stations.)” (5)    “A limited number of owners of prime sites near stations reap… Metro-generated land values as windfalls; this fuels land speculation and gentrification… A universal property-tax abatement [reducing the tax applied to privately-created building values while increasing the tax applied to publicly-created land values]  would bring about results that exceed the wildest dreams of transit supporters and local political leaders” (6)    3) Revenue from a gross receipts tax on regional corporations  Given that they derive immense benefits from a publicly-funded WMATA, a gross receipts tax on regional corporations should be considered with an Ohio-like provision prohibiting pass-on to prices of its products, and WMATA should strongly urge its jurisdictions to all pass this regional tax.

      "response": "DC has the highest income inequality in the nation, compared to the 50 states. Income inequality is the driver of bad outcomes for all our residents, likewise for communities around the world.  DC's Homelessness per capita in 2016 was higher than any major U.S. city. DC's child poverty level is very high, only slighter lower than Mississippi. This the legacy of the heavyweight of the Federal City Council's neoliberal, “balance the budget on the backs of the poor” agenda on our local elected government since the Control Board regime  (see documentation in the 2017 DC Human Rights City Report, at https://www.afsc.org/document/2017-dc-human-rights-city-report; I am on the SC of the DC Human Right City Committee and contributed to this report and the two previous ones). GGW and the Coalition for so-called “Smarter” Growth should sever their ties to the Federal City Council and stop greenwashing gentrification and displacement; case in point, GGW and the Coalition for Smarter Growth's support for the Mayor's plan for McMillan Park (VMP).  As an individual member and representative of the DC Statehood Green Party to the Fair Budget Coalition, I have long advocated, testified to and strongly endorse the following initiatives to reduce income inequality and create a better quality of life for all our residents:  Taxation:  Raise taxes on wealthy individuals [and families] [Much more at: https://www.dcctj.org/)  Increase taxes on developers building high end and luxury condos   Increase corporate tax rates for multi-state and multi-national corporations     Public Deals:  Reconsider subsidized development projects that don't meet basic resident needs (e.g., in 2017, $279 million from the DC Streetcar, $145 million from developments at McMillan, Hill East, St. Elizabeth's, and Walter Reed)    Eliminate subsidies for housing providers/property owners with substandard, unlawful living conditions   End land giveaways and enforces affordable housing regulations on land sold/leased at discounted price   Withdraw all subsidies/abatements from developers/corporations not complying with local hiring, affordable housing regulations or other wage/labor laws   Use money from fund balance and reserve     As a result of these public deals, $ hundreds of millions per year are lost that could go to unmet needs of low-income residents, reducing income inequality in our community.    More specifically, the big federal income tax cut for wealthy DC residents should be recovered as revenue for DC by hiking the DC income tax rates for the same taxpayers, leaving them paying the same overall taxes (federal plus DC) This action would generate at least $250 million extra revenue in 2019, to be used for affordable housing for low-income residents, including the homeless,  e.g., financing community land trusts, repairing public housing, and rental assistance,  and income support for low-income residents ( boosting TANF and tax rebates). For more details see “Who benefits most from the new federal tax legislation and how to use this to increase our revenue stream for low-income residents, meeting unmet needs ?:  https://www.dcctj.org/.  (Note the regressive impact that the new federal tax law has on the DC income tax burdens, namely the steady increase in the \"Change in Effective Rate\", from 0.1% ($500K) to 0.4% ($25K) (see p.20, CFO report, “Summary of the Effects of Major Provisions of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” on District Residents and Businesses”.  The overall tax burden (DC income, property and sales taxes) is already regressive over $50 K family income, even without the federal deduction offset which is now limited to $10,000 (state and local taxes).)   In addition, Bill 22-0701, Closing the Carried Interest Tax Loophole Act of 2018, should be approved by the Council, legislation which would yield approximately $150 million/year of new revenue.      Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?    First, curb subsidies to developers who are prioritizing the creation high income condos/rental units, shift these subsidies to the repair and expansion of public housing, implementation of TOPA, DOPA, community land trusts. A near term solution that could go far in significantly reducing homelessness: expand provision of rapid rehousing and rent supplements to keep individuals and families in this housing once market rates kick in."

Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "I support some of OP's proposals, but I do not think they go far enough. DC has lost half of its truly affordable housing since the last Comprehensive Plan was released in 2006, and I think the new Comprehensive Plan needs to properly reflect that new reality. I have been working with the DC Housing Priorities Coalition to put a greater emphasis on affordable housing and displacement throughout the Comp Plan. I recently hosted a brown bag discussion in the John A. Wilson Building with the coalition so that my colleagues on the Council could hear more about how we can use the Comp Plan to expand affordable housing, grow the city in a more equitable way, and take a stronger stand against displacement – particularly of larger families, low-income households, and Black and Hispanic residents.      Each ward needs to welcome its fair share of affordable housing. In Ward 1 I have preserved or produced more than 500 units of affordable housing (some below 30% AMI, some 30-50% AMI, some 50-80% AMI) in projects such as Park Morton, 965 Florida Avenue, the Grimke School, Portner Flats and the Maycroft. But we still need more.     Our Planned Unit Development system is under threat. In the past 5 years, PUDs have produced 6,000 affordable units, which is about 3,500 more than would have been produced through Inclusionary Zoning alone. Yet, with groups challenging PUDs in court, builders are considering moving away from PUDs altogether and instead building by right. The loss of affordable housing, community benefits, and community input in general should that occur is troubling to consider. We must take steps through the revision of the Comprehensive Plan to prevent courts with little knowledge of zoning law from overturning our local decision-makers.    I've also seen how predatory legal advisors can get involved when affordable housing is being redeveloped through TOPA, and I find it reprehensible. TOPA is the District's law that preserves affordable housing by allowing tenants right of first refusal to purchase their building if it's being sold to a new owner. These predatory advisors present themselves to tenants as advocates for affordable housing, but work on behalf of developers to turn tenants against one another and undermine the TOPA process. I passed emergency legislation in 2015 to prevent one such legal advisor from killing a TOPA project run by Jubilee Housing at the Maycroft in Columbia Heights. We must keep investing in nonprofit housing counseling services that help tenants navigate the TOPA process. My hope is that with all the information at hand, most tenants will opt to work with buyers to keep the building affordable, rather than taking a buy-out that won't give them enough cash to get ahead."

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "Yes. Many of my constituents in Ward 1 do not own a car and commute using a combination of bikes, public transport, and walking. I work to make sure they have a variety of safe options to suit their needs. In a 2015 letter to DDOT I asked them to focus on expanding the protected bike lane routes in Ward 1 to provide better connectivity city-wide. I have advocated for additional lanes in Ward 1, even when it impacted parking. When I was an ANC, I was a champion for the 15th Street bike lanes.     Ward 1 has some of the highest rates of bus and bike ridership in DC, but right now our streets don't reflect that. While some parking may need to be reconfigured or removed for new projects, there may be just as many places where more parking can be added while reducing dangerous speeding.    I've also been working to get dedicated bus lanes on 16th Street for almost a decade now. I'm glad to see the progress we've made on that route, including additional buses started at Harvard Street and articulated buses. I'm eager to see the District move forward with the full implementation of dedicated lanes on this route. I also worked with community advocates to secure funding for the express bus on 14th Street, and have made a request to the Mayor to include funding in her next budget for a route 99 bus with limited stops along the U Street Corridor.     DC in general could do a better job of more quickly prototyping and testing bike and bus lanes rather than having them get caught up in the design phase for years. A bus lane can be piloted with nothing more than a few cones – other jurisdictions have seen great success in these kinds of temporary projects that scale up to something more permanent. The bus lanes on Georgia Avenue work great, but it took a long time to get only a couple of blocks put in.     DDOT's Crosstown Multimodal Transportation study used a great deal of community input to recommend a whole host of improvements to transit and bicycle infrastructure across a large part of Ward 1, and it's important that those recommendations are moved forward effectively."

      "response": "Yes, absolutely. DC has consistently paid its fair share to support Metro over the years, but finding the funding anew each fiscal year creates uncertainly that is not sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, it's always a battle to get Congress to pay its fair share, as well as Maryland and Virginia. A dedicated funding stream in the form of a regional tax is one way we could ensure that Metro has the funding it needs year after year and can do long-range planning to get out of the hole it has been in for years. The governance of Metro under the leadership of the new chair and general manager has been steadily improving, but there is just so much work to do. Resolving the funding issues would go a long way in creating the stability the system needs.     While there are still issues to be worked out with Metro's maintenance and governance structure, those problems are hard to solve without a guarantee of dedicated funding. There's no reason we can't ask for Metro to improve its operations and push for dedicated funding at the same time, rather than making one contingent on the other."

One of the hurdles the current streetcar route faces right now is its limited route. In general, we need to continue investing more in Metrorail and especially Metrobus as well as Streetcar and shared bicycle programs to help our residents easily and safely get to work and school. The more options we have, and the more we do to make them affordable, the better connectivity we will have, and residents will be able to take advantage of the many opportunities coming to the District.     We must also push for the return of late-night Metrorail hours, and consider through-running MARC and VRE, more rideshare drop-off zones, more multi-modal trails and of course, continue our investment in transit-oriented development.

      "response": "Let me start by saying that in general, I prefer transit-oriented development and I supported the reduction of parking minimums in the Zoning Code revisions we completed recently. As an ANC I regularly supported projects that had less parking than was mandated because I believe that we need to be encouraging transit use as much as possible, especially in Ward 1 where we have so much access.     That said, as a ward Councilmember, I understand what it takes to bring resources to a community in need, and often how hard you have to fight to attract the services and amenities your constituents want and deserve.

Do you think DC's historic preservation process is striking the right balance or needs changes to preserve our history without excluding potential residents from many neighborhoods?",
      "response": "One thing I have learned as both an ANC and Councilmember is that there are some very dedicated residents who care deeply about historic preservation. I lived in Meridian Hill when that historic district was being formed, and the primary goal there was to preserve the historic properties adjacent to the park. These were largely former embassies and current community spaces. However, there were a number of homeowners who were concerned about how an historic designation would impact their ability to renovate their homes and build more space to accommodate their families. I also watched this debate unfold in Lanier Heights, where a deeply divided community could not come to consensus over an historic district. More recently, the debate broke down along the same lines regarding down-zoning, which I believe was a bit of a revelation about the intent behind the historic district.      I think we have to honestly ask ourselves whether we are using the tool of historic preservation because we want to preserve history, or because we want to stop growth. Is it necessary to designate entire neighborhoods historic, or could we preserve history by designating specific landmarks instead? I believe in maintaining the unique characteristics of our distinct neighborhoods, but we must also seize opportunities to build densely near transit. That should be happening in every ward. "

      "question": "The District continues to face significant income inequality. What specifically do you think the District should do to close this gap? Relatedly, what you think the District should do to support those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness?",
      "response": "One of the most pressing issues we have right now in the District is a mismatch between our workforce and the jobs that are being created. There are good jobs with real career paths available, but our residents are not being prepared for them. DCPS students being passed through high school and graduated without the skills to succeed in the world is at the heart of this problem. Many of our adults struggle with basic literacy and numeracy. Adult education programs such as Academy of Hope work to address this issue, but it's clearly a failure of our most basic system – public education. I supported the increase in the minimum wage, and that will help. But it takes more than $15 an hour, 40 hours per week to support a family in the District of Columbia. We need to fix this issue in our schools, and do all we can to train the adults we failed when they were in public schools. One of the career paths I've championed on the Council is the Clean Teams. I've established several in Ward 1 and added new positions each year. I love this program because it helps employ people who have struggled to find work, including formerly incarcerated residents, and gives them the chance to move up quickly. It also keeps our commercial corridors clean and safe. We should continue adding Clean Teams around the District.    The cost of living in a city as prosperous as DC is only going to go up. While we are doing the work of better preparing our workforce for careers we need to continue doing all we can to offset the cost of housing. I've worked to preserve and produce more than 500 units of affordable housing in Ward 1 (at 30%, 50% and 80% AMI, but with a strong focus at 50% and below) since I took office three years ago. Preservation is key here, because we cannot build fast enough for the need. The other major investment we've made, that I've supported, is our Local Rent Supplement Program, which gives residents rent vouchers to subsidize existing housing such that they are only paying one third of their income in rent.     As chair of the Committee on Human Services, preventing homelessness and strengthening the District's homelessness emergency services are a major focus of my work. Working with a coalition of providers and residents, I recently reformed the decade-old Homeless Services Act to preserve the District's right to shelter while ultimately strengthening our emergency homeless services. The reforms will allow us to move more families into housing and out of shelter. I also passed landmark reform of the District's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance to hundreds of very low-income District families. The reform keeps families from being cut off and permanently protects assistance for children. It offers more cash assistance without a time limit placed on each family, which will prevent homelessness.     Housing First has been the homelessness policy in the District for several years now, with the belief that helping families find stability in their own home will allow us to better serve their underlying needs, whether they be job readiness, mental health or family conflict. In FY2018 I moved nearly $8 million into housing programs – hundreds of units of Permanent Supportive Housing and Targeted Affordable Housing. I also invested in our Homelessness Prevention Program, which partners families at risk with local organizations like Community of Hope, and helps them stabilize before they become homeless. I also funded the newly launched plan to end youth homelessness, Solid Foundations, in the FY2018 budget. Breaking the cycle of homelessness early can help prevent chronic homelessness. Additionally, I supported adding $100 million each year to the District's Housing Production Trust Fund, which is used to build affordable housing.     The District has a plan to end homelessness called Homeward DC. We must fully fund it in order to eradicate homelessness. While family homelessness is a problem that we will not solve until we address the affordable housing and workforce challenges we face, chronic homelessness is absolutely solvable. By investing in Permanent Supportive Housing, we can get people off the street and help them thrive."

      "response": "Much of the surplus is likely to be needed for our debt service, and we do need to examine doing more pay-go with our capital projects so as not to be carrying so much debt. That said, I would like us to fully fund Homeward DC, the District strategic plan to end homelessness, as well as additional funding to our Local Rent Supplement Program, the Housing Production Trust Fund, and maintenance funds for our public housing stock.     I was one of the few Councilmembers who did not support the roll back of the District's estate tax last year, which will benefit a very small number of residents, and instead offered an amendment to the budget. Unfortunately that amendment failed. I believe we have too many problems – especially affordability and homelessness – and the funding we lost should have been used to address these issues where it could have helped thousands.     Should we find ourselves in a recession, or even with budget shortfalls due to rollbacks of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, we should strongly consider increasing taxes on our wealthiest residents, including an end to the current rollback of the estate tax. With a shortfall that large, we cannot rely on our rainy day fund and otherwise would have to begin cutting services to our residents.  "

      "response": "I have read in detail the “Technical Panel Final Report on Metro” dated April 2017 as well as former Secretary LaHood's reports, both of which concurred on the need for additional funding to ensure capital and maintenance funding, but I cannot accept any of the recommendations in the Technical Panel report on funding sources.      Looking at the proposed budget for WMATA for the next ten years (Page 37 of the final report), the revenue generated from all sources (primarily passenger fees) is only $9.34 billion dollars, while the expected state and local subsidies account for $10.75 billion dollars.  This is before putting in place the additional “dedicated funding” request of approximately $650 million per year ($6.5 billion total over 10 years) that a 1% sales tax would generate.  If the sales tax is put into effect, it would mean that revenues from WMATA metro and bus sales would only account for about one-third of total funding.  While a public transport system can be subsidized by the government, it must also make economic sense to run the system, meaning that fares, capital improvement projects, and expenses have to be grounded in reality in order to keep Metro viable.  The report also makes it clear that increased funding would be needed in perpetuity and hints at other “critical” capital projects that would be needed, beyond those currently identified, that could require even further investment.  It would be irresponsible to place so much of the burden on running the system on only the counties nearest to the Metro through the sales tax.    The approach I would take is to ask our congressional delegation to reach out to the federal government.  The federal government has a special responsibility to support the system given high utilization of Metro by federal employees and by millions of yearly visitors to the Capital, and I would ask our representatives to build on US Rep. Barbara Comstock's WMATA reform bill, to accept some changes in the governance of the WMATA (i.e. instituting a “reform” board), but changing the bill so more funds are provided for ongoing capital investments (than the current 75 million per year) and by moderating some of the unhelpful language against labor unions.  If the federal government is willing to increase its investment, then Maryland, Virginia, and the District as a whole (not just the areas closest to Metro) can make the difficult choices needed to prioritize Metro funding."

      "response": "In principle, I have no objection to Gov. Hogan's proposed widening scheme, provided that it sticks to the promises made in the announcement, namely that NO public funding would be required for the $9 billion project and that current lanes would remain toll-free.  I would love for the new toll lanes to be free or at least subsidized for HOV users, but this is not essential.    In practice, I fear that tolls alone would not make all stretches of the proposed widening area profitable for the private investor(s), and the state would then be asked to come up with funding in those areas, which I would vehemently oppose.  Furthermore, while it would stand to reason that creating more lanes would decrease congestion, there is the downside that more road capacity could invite more traffic.  I will therefore be looking very carefully at the Environmental Impact Statements for the proposed project to study the overall effect.    If Gov. Hogan's proposal does ultimately require public investment, then I would reject it in favor of the transit expansion projects indicated in the question, which would be better value for limited public money."

With greater transit access there will undoubtedly be greater opportunities for employment and higher property values, which are great improvements, but these must be balanced with dedicated efforts to maintaining affordable housing.    Using zoning laws, as we have in Montgomery County, that set aside a certain percentage of units to lower or moderate income families when approving new housing developments is a timely solution, especially as the newly transit-rich areas would presumably promote greater interest by property developers to build new condos and apartment buildings.  Additional measures can include establishing a “Housing Initiative Fund” that can facilitate constructing new affordable housing.      Many of these policies work best on the county level, so I see a limited role for state intervention, but if an appropriate policy is mooted I would certainly give it close attention."

      "response": "I was thrilled by the coordination between a bipartisan group of DMV legislators to cooperate on holding firm on denying public subsidies for a new NFL stadium.  I think this is an excellent approach and a fine example of interjurisdictional cooperation.    Unfortunately, when it comes to other projects, I doubt that such a spirit of cooperation would prevail.  Amazon's second headquarters' bid is too tempting, in terms of the jobs and potential tax revenue generated, to have a united front (particularly since 20 sites were shortlisted, so unlike the stadium, the competition is bound to exceptionally fierce and a united DMV front would likely only see our regions cut from final consideration).      Metro is also an area where I anticipate there will be many disagreements, as each jurisdiction will want to get the best bargain possible.  Although I am personally opposed to a 1% regional sales tax increase, I am mindful that the Technical Panel report showed that such a tax increase would be disproportionate in terms of jurisdictional contributions (D.C. would only contribute 22.8% of the new funds, Maryland 26.5%, and Virginia the remaining 50.7% or so of new funds), so it would only be natural for Virginia politicians to balk at the proposal, and I cannot blame them.      So long as politicians are responsible to their particular constituents, they will find it difficult to respond to a greater “regional” good.  Short of creating a regional government structure (which has no constitutional basis nor public support), it will be up to courageous politicians to work together on an ad hoc basis in rare circumstances, such as with the NFL stadium discussion."

      "question": "Should the state take steps to ensure that existing and newly transit-rich areas (such as the areas surrounding the coming Purple Line) accommodate increased demand to live there, remain affordable to residents of all incomes, and enable existing residents and businesses to enjoy the benefits? What policies would you support?",
      "response": "As we develop new transit (Purple Line, BRT, etc.) and invest in improvements to existing transit (Metro), we must leverage these investments to ensure equity and diversity in housing, employment, and businesses. For example, I support many of the concepts outlined in the Pathways to Opportunity: Purple Line Corridor Action Plan.    We need to ensure that people currently living in these communities have stability in their housing, with particular attention to extremely low income households, who are at the greatest risk of displacement. We must ensure that new housing is affordable to people at all income levels, including opportunities for rental and home ownership. While many of the decisions on housing are made through planning and zoning at the county level, I hope to direct state funds to build and preserve affordable housing in areas close to transit.    I support efforts that focus on pollinating local businesses and micro-entrepreneurs, and harnessing the incredible skill and potential we have in the community to build vibrant local economies. Programs that support local business development should have multilingual and multicultural staff, to ensure that the support is available to all potential entrepreneurs in our community.  I also support the efforts of current D20 delegation members who are seeking funds to support small businesses who might suffer adverse effects through the Purple Line construction period."

How does your approach shape your views on regional projects like Metro, Amazon's HQ2 bid, and a possible new NFL stadium?",
      "response": "We live in a vibrant and exciting region. We have a choice to coordinate to raise our standard of living (such as all jurisdictions committing permanent, dedicated funding to Metro; an increase in the minimum wage across the region) or compete in a race to the bottom. I will advocate for policies that support our entire region and reject competition that hurts us all. I would support bills such as the one Delegate David Moon has proposed for a compact that none of the three governments will provide public financing or incentives for the NFL Stadium for the Washington football team."

      "question": "Prince George's County is the most dangerous in Maryland for pedestrians and cyclists. Why do you think this is? Is there a role for you in changing this?",
      "response": "Prince George's County has struggled and continues to struggle with pedestrian and cycling safety for a host of reasons.  First, the County has many state roads and in fact most of the pedestrian incidents are along these roads.  They are poorly lit, with few safe crossings.  Bus stops are not aligned with crosswalks.  In essence, they were built to move cars and they have never been appropriately retrofitted.  SHA has been slow to come to the table although there are some positive results beginning to happen in part because of the County's focus on this issue.  In addition, the county two years ago hired a bicycle and pedestrian coordinator which is housed in DPWT.  In my experience in District 3, we have seen success in addressing pedestrian safety by creating local work groups with a variety of partners (civic groups, institutions, state, county, nearby businesses) around specific sites whether on Route 1 or on 410 in Riverdale.  The later took 4+ years, but SHA is finally installing a light and enhanced crosswalk at a very dangerous area where lives have been lost.  We are now working with the state and county on improved access to the MARC station at Lanham Severn Road.  In terms of changing the trajectory, it will continue to need prioritization, funding, and frankly some streamlining to deliver key improvements quicker.  The County has updated its regulations which govern new projects and has complete street guidelines now as well as requirements to complete sidewalk/bike gaps offsite.  These should be looked at to see if further enhancements are needed."

More than 1/3rd of stations in Prince George's are now under construction or in the pipeline for development.  New Carrollton and College Park Metro in District 3 are moving forward.  Neither has been easy and much work is ahead to create walkable, mixed use places at our transit nodes.  With the Purple Line, I am focused on achieving the “Opportunity for All” compact and I am working with developers, agencies, and the National Center for Smart Growth to achieve mixed-income, walkable communities along the corridor.

      "response": "I am a strong advocate of developing a Comprehensive Housing Strategy.  I am particularly interested in its focus on senior housing, affordable housing as well as enhancing housing options at metro stations.  The county is limited in addressing evictions and foreclosures of single-family homes except through state legislation.   Over the years, some programs have been established and a task force was created.  Prince George's continues to face a number of foreclosures, which also affects neighborhood quality of life as the homes are vacant.  There are no simple answers to this continued challenge.  It is likely time to revisit with a focus on targeting neighborhoods and zip codes with large number of foreclosures and to understand better how to ensure stability. It will need multiple partners to address--legislation is likely not enough."

      "question": "A development review process known as \"call-up\" was previously struck down by the state Supreme Court, but a similar process, known as \"election,\" is proposed in the current draft of the county's zoning rewrite. Do you support including or removing \"election\" in the final zoning code?",
      "response": "As a sitting Council Member, I rarely elect to review a case.  I expect developers to work with the community in advance and address issues prior to the Planning Board process or during the planning board process. It already takes too long to see development come out of the ground in key corridors and metro stations, so I prefer to not add to the development review process in terms of length and cost. In case you're curious and if I remember correctly, I have only called up one case in three+ years and that is because planning misinterpreted legislation/plan associated with a case.     I support including the option to elect to review for a host of reasons including the following: 1) decisions by District Council need to align with what is in the record and cannot be arbitrary or caprious; 2) Planning Board Members including the Chair are appointed by the Count Executive with no application or public advertisement; 3) District Council acts as a check and balance on the Planning Department where currently the Planning Director lacks planning experience.  If the State enabled the County to operate similar to Montgomery County with Planning appointments (appointed by Council and advertised to ensure best quality board members) and if planning experience was a mandatory qualification for being Planning Director, I may consider this question differently."

Do you support policies in the new Comp Plan to a) add housing in all parts of the city to meet the need, b) create and preserve much more affordable housing, and c) strengthen protections for tenants in affordable housing being redeveloped? How would you achieve these?",
      "response": "Housing unaffordability has become a greater threat to our shared prosperity. I want DC to become a more inclusive city, where people of a wide range of incomes can afford to live.    We must recognize that DC is an increasingly attractive place to live, work and raise a family. That's why we must increase our housing supply to keep up with high demand, with a strong focus on preserving and adding subsidized units. I will advocate for increased housing density along transit corridors for low-to-very-low income residents in the Comprehensive Plan's text and Future Land Use Map.    I would use my council seat to work with advocates who have formed city-wide coalitions and submitted amendments to OP with the purpose of creating and preserving affordable housing     I believe the comprehensive plan should help to ensure that developments are only approved when they preserve or replace each and every existing subsidized home affordable to the poorest households.    I would also introduce a “redevelopment in place” bill, that would direct the DC government to look into funding mechanism to ensure residents are able to stay in their building during renovations. The bill would provide the necessary resources to developers for one-for-one replacement of low-cost units. This could be by delivering subsidies and permitting denser development that can cross-subsidize below-market rate units.    I would also work with the Mayor's office, advocates and the council chair to find ways to utilize community land trusts to build and expand our affordable housing stock (while ensuring long-term affordability).      I would also push for strong vacant property enforcement - at present,  too many are unidentified: That's why I will work to hold DCRA accountable to ensure that every vacant property is identified, pays its fair share in taxes, and is encouraged to be put to good use.    *My legislative director will have experience working on housing legislation with advocates* "

      "question": "Do you support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes? Would you support them even if that required removing on-street parking in some cases? Can you give examples of locations you would or would not like to see a bus and/or protected bike lane?",
      "response": "Yes I support dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes, even if it that meant removing on-street parking in some cases.     The neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River have some of the longest commute times in DC. I would love to see more protected bike lanes and Capital Bikeshare stations in Wards 7 and 8 (e.g. Alabama Ave S.E ). We should also improve bus service in these communities.    While Metrorail attracts all the attention, many DC residents ride Metrobus and Circulator. That's why I support dedicated bus lanes, off board fare payment, transit signal priority, and other measures in key congested corridors throughout the District to save residents' time , increase ridership, and cut down on air pollution. While other cities such as New York, Seattle and Baltimore have dedicated bus lanes and other treatments to speed buses, DC has fallen behind. That's why I support accelerating stalled efforts identified in the MoveDC Plan to create bus-only lanes on Eye St NW and 16th St NW.    Bus lane projects shouldn't take decades to implement. Modeled after a project in the Boston area, I will push DDOT to advance bus lane pilot projects to speed up the implementation of bus lanes quickly without years of excessive study and debate.    I will also work with the Mayor to push WMATA to implement off board fare payment to reduce bus boarding times at busy stops, and offer a low income pass modeled after Seattle's ORCA Lift Pass. Transit fares have risen much faster than inflation while buses are stuck in traffic. We need to give all riders, but especially our poorest residents, more affordable ways to get around.    I am in full support of all the policies within the Complete Streets and Vision Zero plans.     Lastly, I support and look forward to seeing the creation of a bus lane on H St NW and a bike lane along New York Ave NE."

I would work with my council colleagues to always make sure DC is putting up its share of funding (and potentially more if needed) and I will use my position to push regional leaders from MD and VA to come up with their funding.     I would also work alongside organizations and coalitions like the Sierra Club DC to ensure the needs of the community are accounted for in funding proposals, and I will listen to the concerns of ATU and their members to ensure our workers are being heard.

      "response": "Yes, I would be in support of extending the Streetcar but here are some things I would advocate for as the Streetcar is extended:    -I would support funding an educational program and ad campaign to encourage more residents to ride the Streetcar. The Streetcar as a whole is of better use to residents if it's extended and more residents have access and are riding it    -One of the challenges of the H Street line is its slow speed and lack of shared stops with buses. I would fix this on the Streetcar extensions by advocating for the maximum amount of dedicated lanes for the Streetcar, shared stops with buses, and transit signal priority to reduce travel times.    -I would support using funds in target areas around the Streetcar, to expand and preserve affordable housing for low-to-very low income residents.    -I will also look into stabilizing or lowering property taxes in areas around the Streetcar to ensure long-time residents are able to benefit from increased access to transportation options, while staying in the city.     -I will work with DDOT and advocates on a long-term strategy for maintenance of the Streetcars    I believe we should create more dedicated bus and bike lanes, create free wifi access for the whole city (including on all subway platforms). I also support upgrading our grid to build a system that delivers clean, efficient, reliable, local energy to keep our bills low, enhance security and increase local economic resilience. We should also fund and upgrade all future infrastructure with climate impacts in mind. We should be preparing areas like the Southwest Waterfront for climate change impacts.    I would support zoning and infrastructure changes around and above Metro stations to build more affordable housing for low-to-very income residents.     Being the brother of two former inmates, I support the building of a state-of-the-art public jail (a private jail is a non-starter) that supports inmates on their pathway to rehabilitation. I believe the new jail should offer access to jobs, continuing education, and mental health services.     Lastly, some other infrastructure changes I would support include: EV charging stations, EV buses, safer walking infrastructure (more crosswalks, traffic calming, accessibility, etc), better parking management."

For that and other reasons, I was not supportive of the way the TIF proceeded.

      "response": "I am proposing extending access to high quality childcare, using legislative means to ensure all parents have access. Right now, DC has the most expensive childcare system in the United States and many low-to-middle income parents have to make the choice of working or staying home and watching their kid(s).     Ensuring increased access to childcare would allow more parents (especially low-to-no income parents) to enter the workforce or continue their education. I would also work to ensure that paid family leave (a campaign that I was actively involved in) is fully funded and implemented properly. Also, as one of the lead organizers of the campaigns to raise the minimum wage and expand paid sick days, I will work to ensure the Office of Wage-Hour is enforcing the law.    As a member of the DC Food Policy Council and board member of the DC Sierra Club, I have worked with coalitions on expanding grocery store access East of River, and have supported policies to expand transportation options to all parts of the city. Food and transportation are big budget items for low income residents and I will be a strong advocate who will work with coalitions to make food and transportation equitable for all residents.    Housing is also a big cause of income inequality in DC. I think we need to:    Reform rent control: Right now landlords and developers can exploit provisions in DC's rent control law: They're able to use rent adjustment petitions to get tenants to sign “voluntary agreements” and  hardship petitions to increase rents far above rent control limits. We need to close these loopholes that some developers and landlords have been exploiting. I would work with advocates to close these loopholes and strengthen our rent control law.    Expand and increase funding for affordable housing: We need to build more units of affordable housing for low-to-very-low income residents in DC.     I support legislation that would mandate an increase in a percentage of affordable housing for low-to-very income residents in every new development. I would also use legislative measures to push for a comprehensive housing plan that cuts the housing waitlist by 80%. I would also assess the impact of more accurate AMI measurements.     I would work with advocates and the DC government to use community land trusts as a model to build and ensure long-term affordable housing. Lastly, I would support increasing the amount of money we use in the Housing Production Trust Fund. Housing is the #1 concern for residents in Washington, DC: It should be a major part of our budget every year, and I would work with advocates on increasing our housing funding until it is at the appropriate levels to address our housing crisis.     Having a mother who is formerly homeless in DC, this issue is near and dear to my heart. I am in full support of “The Way Home” campaign and their budget and policy priorities to end chronic homelessness. I would work with the partners in that campaign to ensure we are meeting their budget goals each year, until we finally end chronic homelessness in DC.     The DC government also as a plan to end or greatly limit homelessness in DC, the “Homeward DC” plan by 2020. I would work with government officials and advocates to introduce legislation or fight for budget items to make sure we are meeting our 2020 goals. During oversight hearings, I will make sure these goals come up and will question government officials on the progress and what's needed to ensure we are on the right track.    We should also reform rapid rehousing. Here are some of my recommended changes to rapid rehousing:  -I would support adding legal protections for families to make sure they are not trapped in apartments with terrible conditions or safety risks.       -We should also require that families pay no more than 30% of their income towards their housing costs – the standard, nation-wide measure of affordability.       -We should also extend rapid rehousing to 12 months or more, to ensure more families receive the appropriate and consistent case management while we work to find them permanent housing."

      "question": "Are you committed to implementation of Vision Zero (zero traffic deaths)? What is the most important change to the roadways, law, or DOT practices that could bring about Vision Zero?",
      "response": "I am committed to implementing Vision Zero, and I helped lead the Council's efforts to require the County Executive to develop a Vision Zero plan. I strongly believe that our transportation system needs to be redesigned to lower speeds and to ensure that any mistakes made by users do not become deadly. While there is much more to be done and I am not satisfied with the County's progress to date, I have championed numerous reforms that will help get the County to zero deaths by 2030.     Roadways: We need a contemporary road code for the entire county that prioritizes safety for all users and all modes. I have been working on this for several years, and plan to introduce legislation establishing a new road code based on the code developed by Toole Design Group for other local jurisdictions. This new road code will build on the reforms the County achieved when the Council passed my legislation (Bill 33-13 - Urban Road Code) in 2013 that reduced curb radii and lane widths in our urban areas. We also need to budget for road diets.     The County needs significantly more protected bicycle infrastructure so that roads are safe for bicyclists of all ages and all skill levels. We know that more people will ride their bike for trips to transit, shopping, work, entertainment, and recreation if we provide “low stress” connections to their destination. To this end, I have successfully secured new funding for protected bicycle infrastructure in Silver Spring and White Flint and now Bethesda. In this year's capital budget (FY19-FY24), I will be fighting for new funds to build protected bicycle infrastructure in Wheaton, Gaithersburg, and many other areas of the County.      Law: We need the State of Maryland to agree to our vision for Vision Zero and support its implementation on State roads in Montgomery County. For example, last year I pushed for bills in the State legislature to give the County authority to lower speed limits on county roads below 25 mph. While that effort unfortunately did not succeed, I will try again next year hopefully this time with the active support of a stronger Vision Zero coalition. Further, I vigorously supported State legislation in 2017 that would have allowed Maryland DOT to use HAWK signals on State Highways. As a result of the pressure from the legislation and strong local advocacy, Maryland DOT agreed to install a HAWK-like signal at the intersection of Veirs Mill Rd. and Turkey Branch Parkway (Matthew Henson Trail).     DOT practices: For far too long the State and, and to a lesser extent, the County DOT have prioritized motor vehicle traffic flow to the detriment of pedestrian and bicyclist safety. Although both agencies have made improvements recently, larger changes to the mindset and culture are required. The road code changes I mentioned above will codify a better culture top-to-bottom. More specifically, I believe that the County and State DOT need to be much more aggressive in their use of innovative traffic calming measures, speed signs and cameras, and pedestrian activated signals (ie. HAWK signals). I look forward to advocating for these measures and providing our County DOT with sufficient resources to accomplish our collective Vision Zero goals."

With limited county funds and state willingness to fund projects in the county, how would you prioritize these or other projects? Why?",
      "response": "Montgomery County has a long way to go to build an adequate public transportation network so that transit can be an option for people who live in all parts of the County. We should be putting our time and money into reinventing our transportation infrastructure and built environment.     In general, I think the next County Council is an opportunity to reframe the BRT policy issue around what we are trying to achieve through BRT, which is improved performance and reliability for bus service. I have been pushing for the Council to focus on practical implementations. I favor significant investments in bus infrastructure along Routes 29, 586, and 355 (starting with the Northern segment), and I think we can achieve all of these in the next Council term.    MARC expansion and I-270 (and I-495) are state projects that do not require county funding. I think the State should continue forward with a MARC expansion as I believe that is an undervalued transportation service that could play a much bigger role as a commuter rail system with some smart investments. I support the Council's adopted vision for the American Legion Bridge and I-270, which is a targeted approach.  I would favor a statewide focus on MARC over the plan that the Governor has put forward.    I do not support funding M-83, but I do support other projects that will service the Clarksburg and East Germantown community, including various road improvements in that area, express bus service on 355 (BRT for 355 North is currently in design), shuttles to the Metro and MARC, and more MARC service. As for Montrose Parkway East, I do not think it is needed at this time, and the Council has better opportunities to improve transportation infrastructure in that area, such as improving the Metro stations, bike infrastructure and investing in rebuilding 355 to be consistent with the master plan vision for the area."

If you have examples for additional streamlining please share. Regarding parking minimums, my understanding is that the issue here is not county requirements (which are minimal) but rather that developers continue to find that a certain higher level of parking is necessary to secure investment in the project.

      "response": "New housing at or below 50% AMI can only be created by subsidy or mandate. 100% AMI is generally about market level, or the price that new housing comes on to the market; housing that is half that cost exists naturally or without subsidy only because it is older.    Creating new housing at 50% AMI requires investment from the Housing Initiative Fund, the Housing Opportunities Commission, or nonprofit providers, which I have supported at every opportunity. Sometimes these providers buy MPDUs (65% AMI) to offer to their clients at discounted rates (50% or lower AMI), which is one reason my legislation raising the MPDU requirement to 15% in low poverty school clusters is important. It will promote economic integration.     In recent Master Plans, the Council has taken creative and bold steps to increase or modernize the supply of subsidized affordable housing. The Westbard, Lyttonsville and Bethesda Master Plans all included zoning that was intended to incentivize public private partnerships between affordable housing developers such as HOC or MHP and private developers such as EYA.    It is also important that we not lose what affordable housing we have in that income range, so we must continue to expand the HIF so that the County can take advantage of opportunities to purchase older housing stock and then maintain it affordable levels.     Our recent tenant rights and code inspection law will also help maintain the quality of existing affordable housing. Preventing these existing affordable communities from declining is crucial."

      "response": "Housing and child care are badly needed. I would like to see the Victory Housing proposal add more child care. I would like to see the Gudelsky plan add more housing. I will support the project that provides the most public benefits. A larger building is fine in this location.     My general approach to development is well reflected in the Master Plans that the County Council has adopted, such as Lyttonsville, Bethesda, Grosvenor, and many more: plans that take bold steps towards our future with significant zoning capacity for housing; prioritizing walkability and public transportation, adequate parks and public facilities."

      "response": "When I work on a master plan, I keep broad public policy concerns top of mind; those tend to benefit the community as a whole and over the long term. I engage deeply with the residents in the community, while seeking to contextualize their concerns appropriately within the broader policy framework or vision for the future that I embrace.     During this council term, we have enacted master plans for Westbard, Lyttonsville, Bethesda, Grosvenor, Rock Spring, and White Flint 2. They are all great plans in my opinion, although you would not be surprised to hear me say that since I played a lead role in crafting them. Nevertheless, we heard from many different voices in the community for each plan. I believe and hope that most people came out of that community planning process feeling that they were heard. I think the plans speak for themselves as they are strong plans that make real advances on a variety of different land use, housing, transportation, school, park and environmental concerns."

Accordingly, I support a dedicated funding source for Metro, believe one is long overdue, and would  support a tax to fund it, including a regional sales tax or even a tax on ride sharing companies like Lyft and Uber. However, we need to consider options like curbing labor costs in order to make this feasible. And of course, we need the buy in of the District of Columbia and Virginia for this to become a reality.

The evidence is overwhelming that widening lanes does nothing to alleviate congestion. However, while I am indeed a proponent of transit, and would prioritize expanded hours of operation for MARC, transit projects like BRT, and the CCT, I also believe that road maintenance, road-based solutions, are a critical part of the transportation mix, and cannot be ignored.

It is incumbent upon policy makers to ensure that as we work to provide much-needed transit solutions, that we not lose sight of the needs of the financially vulnerable. I would support policies which provide for greater density around transit centers. I would support tax incentives for landlords who keep rents affordable around transit centers.

As a daily public transit user, I am all too familiar with the significant reliability and maintenance issues that have befallen the metro system. Without a reliable stream of funding for capital repairs and improvements, the system will continue its downward decline. If elected, I would support Del. Korman's Maryland Metro Funding Act, which will provide mandatory, dedicated funding through the MDOT capital program, increasing 3% annually. I would work with colleagues in Congress, the Virginia legislature and DC Council to secure similar agreements from each jurisdiction. I do not require other reforms before supporting this necessary funding, although I am interested in seeing additional steps taken by Metro to become more consumer and customer focused.

But simply expanding the metropolitan area's highways is neither an innovative, nor an efficient, way to address the issue. Expansion of highways is detrimental to public spaces, the environment, and to the numerous commuters in Montgomery County who do not drive. Maryland, and Montgomery County, have to live up to their reputation as leaders in progressive action, and find ways to invest more in sustainable public transportation solutions that will build a foundation for long-term regional prosperity.  We need to continue to invest in proposed transit projects like the Purple line, METRO and Rapid Bus Transit.   "

As Delegate to the Maryland House of Representatives, I will work to make sure that Maryland delivers viable options for every transit need, and that the State Highway Administration is sufficiently empowered to service these.

What policies would you support?",
      "response": "The average wage required in Maryland to rent a 2 bedroom home is $28.27 per hour. The average wage earned by a renter in Maryland is $16.88. That statistic alone displays the urgent need for affordable housing solutions in the state. Maryland has been working hard to attract, retain and regain business investment, and with that comes the responsibility of providing housing options to people across the socioeconomic spectrum. More than 60% of residents in Maryland who received housing assistance pay more than half their incomes on rent. The housing cost-burden on seniors and lower wage earners in the state is unconscionable. This takes on particular significance in light of the Trump administration's slashing of housing assistance in the budget. And while much of the discourse is around households that require housing assistance funds, the struggle to find affordable housing is not restricted to those households alone. To start with, I strongly support the passage of the Home Act of Maryland, which prohibits landlords from discriminating against renters based on their source of income. I will also work to find solutions through rent stabilization, by strengthening just-cause eviction policy and strong enforcement of the building code to make sure that all developments have the amount of affordable housing units they need to have."

We need to work on collaborative efforts in relation to transportation, like METRO.  In terms of Amazon's HQ2 bid, whichever of the three wins, the impact on neighboring areas will be huge.

      "response": "I fully support a dedicated funding stream for Metro.  Indeed, I find it odd that this is something that isn't already in place.  Given the size and ridership levels Metro has, it is the only mass transit system on that scale that doesn't have a dedicated funded stream.  It is no mere coincidence that safety and reliability have declined as ridership has increased because (due to a lack of dedicated funding) Metro to keep up with necessary maintenance and improvements.   To provide funds I would propose an increase in the gas tax, with all proceeds from the increase reserved for Metro.  Ideally, this would be accomplished on a region wide level, imposing the same increase across Maryland, Virginal and Washington.  Additionally, while I prefer some changes to be made; restructuring of the board, requirement of best value contracting and project labor agreements, I would still support creating the funding stream even if my preferences weren't in place.  The reason for this is I view the funding as vital and long overdue.  The additional changes can be fought for but nothing should jeopardize creating a dedicated funding stream.  "

      "response": "The highway expansion proposed by Governor Hogan is a difficult proposition.  Clearly, traffic in the region is getting worse.  Expanding 495 and 270 would give our highways more capacity but, ultimately, I don't believe that is a viable long term solution to our traffic problem.  It is a (very expensive) stop gap measure at best.  I believe that would be better spent expanding our mass transit options. In particular, expanding the MARC, Metro and growing the BRT system."

Again, the best way to get cars off the road (and thereby reducing traffic) is to provide accessible and convenient alternative methods of transportation.  Due to its (relatively) low cost and effectiveness, making our state highways more bike-friendly (ideally through dedicated bike lanes) and walkable she be one of our primary tools in reducing congestion.

One way to do this would be to expand the programming under the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust in order to include support for low-income residents in private developments.  Similarly, for businesses, the State could create a program along the lines of the Wheaton Small Business Assistance program which is designed to help small business during the redevelopment taking place in the Wheaton Triangle."

      "response": "While our region shares many things, there will always be separate interest for the jurisdictions that make up our region.  Keeping that in mind, I think legislators should develop and implement plans that serve their jurisdictions long-term interest and be open to buying to a bigger regional picture when appropriate.  To that end, I am fully supportive of the efforts being made by Maryland to attract Amazon to Montgomery County.  A large chunk of the proposed investment (approx. $2B) is to be dedicated to infrastructure improvements (which we need whether Amazon relocates here or not) and if attracting Amazon here is a way to secure those funds, then I am supportive as the infrastructure will serve our regions long term interest with or without Amazon.  As for a NFL stadium, I don't support public financing (not even through tax incentives) for sports venues.  The data consistently shows that jurisdictions that do this rarely achieve a favorable ROI.  In addition, given the budget constraints we face, we can and should place those investments in to things that will provide for the health of our economy for the long-term (like education)."

      "response": "I support housing choices in Montgomery County, and different kinds of communities that grow organically. I believe that it is a mistake to assume that one size fits all, and that the same zones will work everywhere in the County based on nothing more than a property's distance from various forms of transportation. Through the master plan process, and not through simple rezoning, the County can work to retain naturally occurring affordable housing, build more affordable housing, and create communities with adequate schools, transportation infrastructure, parks and other amenities. In order to increase our stock of multifamily and other kinds of affordable housing, we must create a transportation system that works everywhere in the County."

      "response": "a) The “Rental Housing Market” study has excellent recommendations for capturing naturally occurring affordable housing before it is redeveloped and for providing more housing vouchers. I would start with the recommendations of this study.  b) Another key to more affordable housing is a better functioning, more comprehensive transportation system that enables jobs to be closer to housing. I support BRT where appropriate and would work to improve our bus routes and transportation systems to expand opportunities for those who live outside of expensive TOD centers (Silver Spring, Bethesda and White Flint).  c) I support the County's nationally recognized MPDU program as an important component to the County's affordable housing program. We must all recognize, however, that whether it is 12.5% or 15% of units in a building, the program still provides relatively few housing units and not nearly enough housing for people and families making less than 60% of Area Median Income (AMI).  d) I support the County's policy of co-locating housing on County-owned land, including parking garages, because the use of public land reduces the cost of the housing considerably.  e) Given data showing that certain Short Term Rentals (STRs) take housing units off the long-term rental market, the County should consider an additional tax on STRs to be applied to the County's Housing Initiative Fund.  f) I support opportunities to direct local philanthropists to local needs. There are national affordable housing financing institutions that offer investors the chance to direct their funds to local efforts."

I support dedicated bondable funding, as it is the only means of ensuring proper maintenance of the system, let alone adequate expansion. Having grown up in New York I know how important such a steady stream can be.    I would prefer this to be paid for with special property tax plans for areas around Metro stations that benefit from the close access, but would also support, if necessary, an increase in the gas tax or a regional sales tax, being aware that such taxes (gas and sales) are regressive.

      "response": "I support the community in making this sight apart of the park. I would like to see more children and families out of the house and enjoying the outdoors. We have so many new developments already and more under construction. We need to secure what we have before we add to the chaos. Any new development needs to directly benefit the welfare, growth and health of our residence.   "

That would be like having half a Metro line and no others. He's also being disingenuous when he says he \"ensured\" funding. He chopped most of the money away and moved the remainder to the sixth year of the budget cycle. Mendo doesn't get transportation and on budget matters, he usually responds to criticism by seeking to confuse people.",
